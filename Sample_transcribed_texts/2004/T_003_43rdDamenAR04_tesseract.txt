MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(UNAUDITED)

‘As management ofthe 43rd and Damen Tax increment Redevelopment Project Area (Project), we offer the readers
ofthe Project's fnancial statements tis naatve overview and analyss of the Projects financial performance for
the year ended December 31, 2004. Please read itin conjunction wan the Project's nancial staiements, which
follow this section,

Overview ofthe Financial Statements

‘This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction tothe Project's basic nancial statements
‘The Project's basic nancial statements Include three components: 1) govemment-vide ancl statements, 2)
‘govermenta fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the nancial statements. This report also contains ther
‘supplementary information concerning the Project's expenditures by statutory code,

Basic Financial Statements. The basic fnancial statements include two kinds of financial statements that
resent diferent views ofthe Project ~ the Govemment-Wide Financial Statements and the Governmental Fund
‘Financial Statements. These financial statemens also incude the notes tothe fnancal statements that explain
some of the information inthe financial statements and provide more deta.

Government-Wice Financil Statements provide both longterm ané short-term information about the Project's
financial status and use accountng mathods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement
of net assets includes all ofthe project's assets and lables. All of the current year's revenues and expenses
‘10 accounted for in the statement of activites regardless of when cash is received or paid, The two
govemmentsvide statements report the Projects net assets and how they have changed. Net assets ~ the
Gtorence between the Project's assets and lables ~ is one way to measure the Projects financial health, oF
Postion.

Govermmental Fund Financial Statements prove more detalles information about the Project's significant funds
not the Project as a whole. Governmental funds focus on: 1) how cash and other francial assets can readily
bbe converted to cash flows and 2) the yearend balances that are available for spending. Consequently. the
{governmental fund statements provide a detailed shor-torm view that helps determine whether there are more
financial resources that can be spent inthe near future to france the Project. Because this information does not
lencompass the additonal long-term focus ofthe government wide statements, we provide additonal information|
atthe bottom ofthe statements to expan the relatonship (or differences) between them

‘Noles to the Financial Statements. The notes provide adstional information that Ie essential to a full
Understanding ofthe data provided in the govermentwide and governmental find fancal statements, The
notes to the financial statements follow the Basie nancial statements

Other Supplementary information. In addlton to the basic nancial statements and accompanying notes, this
‘eport aso presents @ schedule of expenditures by statutoy code. This supplementary information follows the
‘oles tothe fnancial statements
