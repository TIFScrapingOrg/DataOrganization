Projects francial performance for the year ended December 31, 2004, Please read itn conjunction with the
Projects financial statements, which folow tis secton.

Overdw of the Financial Statements

‘This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an inoducton tothe Project's basic financial statements.
‘The Project's basic nancial statements include three components: 1) goverment-vide fancial statements, 2)
governmental fund financial statements, and 3) notes tothe financial statements. This repo also contains other
supplementary information concerning the Project's expensitures by statutory code,

Basic Financial Statements. The basic nancial statements include two kinds of nancial statements that
‘resent diferent views ofthe Project ~ the Goverment-Wide Financial Statements and the Governmental Fund
Financial Statements. These financial statements also incude the notes tothe financial statements that explain,
‘some ofthe information Inthe financial statements and provide more detail.

Government-Wide Financia! Statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the Project's
financial siatus and use accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement
of net assets Inciudes all of the project's assets and lables. All of the curren year's revenues and expenses
‘are accounted for in the statement of actives regardless of when cash is received or paid, The ‘wo
‘goverment.wide statements report the Project's net assets and how they have changed. Net assats ~ the
<fference between the Project's assets and liaities ~ is one way to measure the Projects financial heath, or
postion

Governmental Fund Financial Statements provide more detailed information about the Project's significant funds
= not the Project as a whole. Governmental funds focus on: 1) haw cash and other francal assets can readily
bbe converted to cash flows and 2) the year-end balances that are available for spending. Consequenty, the
{governmental fund statements provide a detalles short-term view that helps determine whether there are more
financial resources that can be spent inthe near future to ance the Project. Because this information does not
encompass the additonal long-term focus ofthe government-wide statements, we provide adaional information
atthe bottom ofthe statements to explain the relationship (or diferences) between them.

Notes to the Financial Statements. The notes provide addtional information that is essential to @ full
Understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and governmental fund fancial statements. The
‘notes othe fnancal statements follow the basic financial statements,

Cother Supplementary Information. In addition to the basic nancial statements and accompanying notes, this
report also presents @ schedule of expenditures by statutoy code. This supplementary information fllows the
‘ates tothe nancial statements.
