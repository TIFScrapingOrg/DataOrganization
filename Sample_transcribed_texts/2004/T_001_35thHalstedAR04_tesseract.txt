‘hs secton

‘Oveniow ofthe Financial Statements

This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction tothe Project's basic financial statements.
The Project's basic iancial statements Include three components: ) government wide financial statements, 2)
‘govermmental fund nancial statements, and 3) notes tothe fnancial statements. This report also contains other
‘Supplementary information concerning the Project's expenditures by statutory code,

‘Basic Financial Statements. The basic fnancial statements include two kinds of financial statements that
present citferent views ofthe Project ~ the Govemment-Wide Financial Statements end the Governmental Fund
Financial Statoments. These fancial statements also incude the notes to the francal statements that explain
‘some ofthe information inthe financial statements and provide mare deta.

Govemment-Wide Financial Statements provide both long-erm and short-term information about the Projects
financial status and use accountng methods similar to tose used by private-sector companies. The statement
of net assets Includes all ofthe project's assets and lables. All of the current year's revenues and expenses
0 accounted for in the statement of activites regardiess of when cash is received oF paid. The two
‘government-wide statements report the Project's net assets and how they have changed. Net assets ~ the
<iference between the Project's assets and lables ~ Is one way to measure te Project's financial heath, or
position

Governmental Fund Financial Statements prove more detailed information about the Project's significant funds
not the Project as a whole. Governmental funds focus on: 1) how cash and other francal assets can ready
bbe converted to cash flows and 2) the year-end balances that are avallable for spending. Consequently, the
governmental fund statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine whether there are more
nancial resources that can be spent i the near future to france the Project. Because this information does not
encompass the additional long-term focus ofthe government-wide statements, we provide additonal information
at the bottom ofthe statements to explain the relatonship (or differences) between them.

Notes to the Financial Statements. The notes provide addtionsl information that 's essential to a ful
Understanding of the data provided in the govemmentwide and govemmental fund francial statements. The
