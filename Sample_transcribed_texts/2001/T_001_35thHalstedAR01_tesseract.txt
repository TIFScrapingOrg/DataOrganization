City of Chicago, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
the 35th and Halsted Redevelopment Project of the

the city of

express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our

audite

fe conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United states of
america.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the

Hinancial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence

supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.

An audit also includes assessing the

accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall

Financial statenent presentation. We believe that our
audite provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the
Financial position

City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December 31, 2001
and 2000,

and the results of its operations and changes in fund

an opinion on the financial statenents taken as a
whole. The

Schedule of expenditures by statutory code on page 6,
which is also the responsibility of the city of
Chicago's

management, is presented for purposes of additional
analysis and is not a required part of the financial

of Chicago, Illinois. such additional information has
been

subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the

We have audited, in’ accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United states of
america, the

balance sheet of 35th and Halsted Redevelopment,
Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois as of
December 31, 2001,

and the related statement of revenues, expenditures
and changes in fund balance for the year then ended,
and

have issued our report thereon dated May 6, 2002

In connection with our audit, nothing came to our
attention that caused us to believe that the Project

with the regulatory provisions in subsection (q) of
Section 11-74.4-2 of the Illinois Tax Increment
Allocation
Redevelopment Act and Subsection (0) of Section
11-74.6-10 of the Illinois Industrial Jobs Recovery

relate to the eligibility for costs incurred
incidental to the implementation of the 35th and
Haleted Redevelopment

Project of the City of Chicago, I1linois.

This report is intended for the information of the
City of Chicago's management. However, this report is
a matter of
