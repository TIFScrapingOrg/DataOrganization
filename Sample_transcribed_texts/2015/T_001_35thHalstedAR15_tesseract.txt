the Project's financial statements this narrative overview and analysis ofthe Project’ tancial poformance for te
year ended December 3, 2015. Please read itn conjunction with the Project's financial statements, which folow
{is section.

Overview ofthe Financial Statements

‘Tis discussion and analysis intended to serve a¢ an introduction to the Projects basic fnancal statements
‘The Project's basic financial staiements include three components: 1) government-wide fnancal statements, 2)
‘governmental fund francial statements, and 3) notes to the nancial statements. This report also contains other
‘Supplementary information concerning the Projec's expenditures by statutory code

Basie Financial Statements

‘The basic financal statements include two kinds of fnaneial statements tht present diferent views of the
Project ~ the Government-Wide Financial Statements and the Governmental Fund Financial Statements. These
financial etatemens sso inéude the notes tothe financial statements that explain some ofthe formation in the
financial statements and provide more deta

Government-Wide Financial Statements

The government-wide financial statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the Project's
financial status and use accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement
‘of net poston includes al of the projec’ assets and lables. All ofthe current year's revenues and expenses
fare accounted for in the statement of aces regardless of when cash is received or pald. The two
‘overnment-nide statements report the Projets net postion and how they have chenged, Net position ~ the
Giflrence between the Project's assets and lables ~ Is one way to measure the Project's nancial health, or
Peston.

Governmental Fund Finencil Statements

‘The governmental fund financial stalements provide more detaled information about the Project's significant
funds ~ not the Project sa whole. Governmental funds focus on: 4) how oash and other financial assets can
ready be converted i cash flows and 2) the yaar-ond balances that are avalable for spending. Consequenty,
the governmental fund statements provide a detaled shorter view that helps determine whether there are
‘mere financial resources that can be spent In the near future to finance the Project. Because this information
does nat encompass the additonal long-term focus ofthe government-wide statements, we provide adctional
Information atthe bottom of the statements to explain the relationship (or eifferences) between them
