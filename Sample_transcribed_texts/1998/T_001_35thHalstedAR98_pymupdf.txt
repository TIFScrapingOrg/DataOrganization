1998 Annual Report 
Purpose of Report:

~-,-- -,---
~~-'-~--,--~~---~-=-~~--~ ---~--o~~-~--0~-r 
The purpose of the Annual Report for the 35th and Halsted Redevelopment Project Area (Report) is 
to provide information regarding the City of Chicago (City) tax increment financing (TIF) districts in 
existence on December 31, 1998, as required by the Mayor's Executive Order 97-2 (Executive 
Order). This Report covers the 35th and Halsted Redevelopment Project Area (Project Area). 
Methodology: 
In the process of providing information about the Project Area, care was taken to follow the 
organization of the Executive Order to allow the reader to locate needed information in an efficient 
manner. The Report reflects only TIF economic activity during 1998, also referred to in this reportas 
"the prior calendar year." As outlined below, several assumptions were made concerning certain 
required information. 
(a) General Description 
The general boundaries of the Project Area are described and illustrated in a map. However, in order 
to provide ease of reading, only major boundary streets are identified. For exact boundaries, the 
interested reader should consult the legal description of the Project Area boundaries found in the 
Redevelopment Plan (Attachment). 
(b) Date of Designation and Termination 
For purposes of this Report, the date of termination is assumed to occur 23 years from the date of 
designation, the maximum duration currently allowed under the Tax Increment Allocation 
Redevelopment Act. 
(c) Copy of Redevelopment Plan 
The Redevelopment Plan, as amended (if applicable), for the Project Area is provided as the 
Attachment at the end of the Report.

(d) Description of Intergovernmental and Redevelopment Agreements 
Table D describes agreements related to the Project Area which are either intergovernmental 
agreements between the City and another public entity or redevelopment agreements between the 
City and private sector entities interested in redeveloping all or a portion of the Project Area. The 
date of recording of agreements executed by the City in 1998 and filed with the Cook County 
Recorder of Deeds is included in Table D (if applicable). 
(e) Description of TIF Projects 
Table E describes each TIF project in the Project Area that has already received approval by the 
Community Development Commission, and which received TIF financing during 1998. Those 
projects in discussion, pre-proposal stage with a developer, or being reviewed by Community 
Development Commission staff are not "projects" for purposes of the Report. The amount budgeted 
for project costs and the estimated timetable were obtained from the Project Area's 
intergovernmental or redevelopment agreements, if such agreements exist. Table E specifically 
notes: 
1) the nature of the project; 
2) the budgeted project cost and the amount of TIF assistance allocated to the project; 
3) the estimated timetable and a statement of any change in the estimate during the prior 
calendar year; 
4) total City tax increment project expenditures during the prior calendar year and total City 
tax increment project expenditures to date; 
5) a description of all TIF financing, including type, date, terms, amount, project recipient, 
and purpose of project financing.

(f) Description of all TIF Debt Instruments 
Table F describes all TIF debt instruments related to the Project Area in 1998. It should be noted 
that debt instruments issued without a security pledge of incremental taxes or direct payments from 
incremental taxes for principal and interest are not included in Table F, as such instruments do not 
qualify as TIF debt instruments as defined by the Executive Order. Table F includes: 
1) the principal dollar amount of TIF debt instruments; 
2) the date, dollar amount, interest rate, and security of each sale of TIF debt instruments 
and type of instrument sold; 
3) the underwriters and trustees of each sale; 
4) the amount of interest paid from tax increment during the prior calendar year ( 1998); 
5) the amount of principal paid from tax increment during the prior calendar year ( 1998). 
(g) Description of City Contracts 
Table G provides a description of City contracts related to the Project Area, executed or in effect 
during 1998 and paid with incremental tax revenues. In addition, the date, names of all contracting 
parties, purpose, amount of compensation, and percentage of compensation paid is included in the 
table. Table G does not apply to any contract or contract expenditure reported under (e)(5) of 
Section 4 of the Executive Order. 
City contracts related to the Project Area are defined as those contracts paid from TIF funds, not 
related to a specific TIF project, and not elsewhere reported. Items include, but are not limited to, 
payments for work done to acquire, dispose of, or lease property within a Project Area, or payments 
to appraisers, surveyors, consultants, marketing agents, and other professionals. These services may 
affect more than one project in a Project Area and are not otherwise reported. Table G does not 
report such noncontractual cost items as Recorder of Deeds filing fees, postage, telephone service, 
etc. City contracts include term agreements which are city-wide, multi-year contracts that provide 
goods or services for various City departments.

the City for assisting to establish the Project Area and paid by any entity that has received or is

consultant who has prepared at least one redevelopment plan for the establishment of a 
redevelopment project area within the City in 1998. The Executive Order specifically applies to 
contracts that the City's tax increment advisors or consultants, if any, have entered into with any

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
The Honorable Richard M. Daley, Mayor 
Members of the City Council 
City of Chicago, Illinois 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the 35th and Halsted 
Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December 31, 
1998 and 1997, and the related statements of revenues, expenditures and 
changes in fund balance for the years then ended. 
These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the City of Chicago's management. 
Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of the 35th and Halsted 
Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December 31, 
1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and changes in fund balance 
for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles. 
As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1998 the 35th and 
Halsted Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois changed its 
method of accounting for investments.

the information certain procedures prescribed by professional standards 
because of the unprecedented nature of the year 2000 issue and its effects, 
and the fact that authoritative measurement criteria regarding the status of 
remediation efforts have not been established. 
In addition, we do not 
provide assurance that the City of Chicago is or will become year 2000 
compliant, that the City of Chicago's year 2000 remediation efforts will be 
successful in whole or in part, or that parties with which the City of 
Chicago does business are or will become year 2000 compliant. 
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the 
financial statements taken as a whole. 
The schedule of cash activities on 
page 9 and the schedule of expenditures by statutory code on page 10, which 
are also the responsibility of the City of Chicago's management, are 
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of 
the financial statements of 35th and Halsted Redevelopment Project of the 
City of Chicago, Illinois. 
Such additional information has been subjected 
to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the financial statements 
and, 
in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects when 
considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Note 1 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Project 
The 35th and Halsted Tax Increment Redevelopment Project Area 
(Project) was established in January 1997. 
The area has been 
established to finance improvements, leverage private investment 
and create and retain jobs. 
Reimbursements, if any, are made to 
the developer for project costs, 
as public improvements are 
completed and pass City inspection. 
Basis of Accounting 
The Project is accounted for within the special revenue funds 
of the City. 
The financial statements are prepared on the modified accrual 
basis of accounting and current financial resources measurement 
focus with only current assets and liabilities included on the 
balance sheet. 
Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, 
revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual, i.e. , 
both 
measurable and available to finance expenditures of the current 
period. 
Available means collectible within the current period or 
soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current 
period.

assets are not capitalized in the general operating 
instead, are charged as current expenditures when 
The General Fixed Asset Account Group of the City 
capital assets, if any, of the Project. 
Management's Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Illinois Tax Increment Redevelopment Allocation Act Compliance 
The Project's expenditures include reimbursements for various 
eligible costs as described in subsection (q) of Section 11-74.4-3 
of the Illinois Tax Increment Redevelopment Allocation Act and the 
Redevelopment Agreement relating specifically to the Project. 
Eligible costs include but are not limited to survey, property 
assembly, rehabilitation, public infrastructure, financing and

Cash and Investments 
-6-
Cash belonging to the City is generally deposited with the 
City Treasurer as required by the Municipal Code of Chicago. 
The 
City Comptroller issues warrants for authorized City expenditures 
which represent a claim for payment when presented to the City 
Treasurer. 
Payment for all City warrants clearing is made by 
checks drawn on the City's various operating bank accounts. 
The City Treasurer and City Comptroller share responsibility 
for investing in authorized investments. Interest earned on pooled 
investments is allocated to participating funds based upon their 
average combined cash and investment balances. 
On January 1, 1998, the City adopted GASB Statement No. 31, 
"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain Investments and for 
External Investment Pools." 
Accordingly, the City values its 
investments at fair value, or amortized cost . 
Property Taxes 
Property taxes are susceptible to accrual and recognized as a 
receivable in the year levied. 
Revenue recognition is deferred 
unless the taxes are received within 60 days subsequent to year-
end. 
Note 2 - Operating Transfers In 
During 1997 in accordance with state statutes, the Project 
received $1,743,618 
from the contiguous Stockyards Northwest 
Quadrant 
Redevelopment 
Project 
for 
the 
acquisition 
and 
redevelopment of property within the Project area. 
Note 3 - Commitments 
As of December 31, 1998 the Project has entered into contracts 
for approximately $28,000 for services and construction projects.

with embedded microprocessor chips to recognize calendar dates beyond the 
year 1999. Unless such programs and microprocessors are modified or replaced 
prior to the year 2000, they may not function properly after 1999. 
The City formed an executive committee in May 1998, to oversee possible 
City-wide year 2000 impacts. 
The Department of Business and Information 
Services has been charged with managing the City's year 2000 project. 
The 
year 2000 issue is covered within the scope of the City's year 2000 project. 
The year 2000 project is divided into stages as follows: 
Awareness Stage -
Establishing a budget and project plan for dealing 
with the year 2000 issue. 
Assessment Stage - Identifying the mission critical systems, equipment 
and individual components for which year 2000 compliance is needed. 
Remediation Stage - Making changes to systems and equipment. 
Validation/testing Stage - Validating and testing the changes that were 
made during the remediation stage. 
The City committed approximately $28.2 million and $32.0 million in 199.8 and 
1999, respectively, for the repair and replacement of year 2000 compromised 
systems. 
As of December 31, 1998, the City entered into contracts for 
approximately $17.7 million for the test plan development, audit stages and 
upgrade of certain software programs. 
~ssion Critical Applications 
The City has identified one computer application, the Chicago Accounting and 
Purchasing System, as critical to conducting the operations for year 2000 
compliance. 
As of December 31, 1998, the City completed the awareness and 
assessment stages, and the remediation stage was in process for the above 
mission critical component. This mission critical component is still subject 
to the validation/testing stage. 
The City-wide completion of all stages is 
scheduled for September 1999. 
Embedded Systems 
The awareness stage, including an inventory of embedded systems has been 
completed. 
Baseline assessment of mission critical functions involving 
embedded systems was substantially completed by the end of the first quarter 
of 1999. 
The City has retained outside consultants to manage and implement 
completion of this aspect of the year 2000 project by the end of September 
1999.

The City also initiated an assessment of mission critical vendors, which is 
being performed by a consultant with oversight from the executive committee 
to plan for continuity in the City's supply chain. 
Contingency planning for 
mission critical systems and other elements of the year 2000 project is 
scheduled to be completed by the end of September 1999. 
The above description of the stages of work to address the year 2000 issues 
is not a guarantee those systems will be year 2000 compliant. 
Although the 
City is currently on schedule to meet its objectives for year 2000 
compliance, there is no assurance that compliance will be achieved in a 
timely manner. 
Further, if the City successfully addresses its year 2000 
issues, there is no assurance that any other entity or governmental agency 
(including governmental organizations or entities that provide essential 
infrastructure) with which the City electronically interacts will be year 
2000 compliant. 
At this time, the City can not determine the potential 
impact of such noncompliance on the business and financial condition or the 
results of its operations.

I. INTRODUcnON 
The 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project Area (hereafter referred to as the "Redevelopment Project 
Area") is located on the near southwest side of the city of Chicago, approximately three to four miles 
from the central business district; much of it is encompassed by the Stockyards Industrial Corridor. 
The Redevelopment Project Area comprises approximately 518 acres and includes 63 (full and 
partial) city blocks. It is generally bounded by 31st and 35th Streets on the north; property fronting 
Morgan Street and Halsted Street. and the alley between Halsted and Emerald Streets on the east; 
Pershing Road on the south; and Ashland and Daman Avenues on the west. The boundaries of the 
Redevelopment Project Area are shown on Map 1, Redevelopment Project Boundary. 
The Redevelopment Project Area is located within a larger community that was once a major 
industrial center that included the Union Stock Yards and the Central Manufacturing District(CMD). 
Its development patterns reflect these earlier land uses. Today, the Redevelopment Project Area 
still contains primarily industrial, residential, commercial, and institutional land uses. It continues to 
be well suited for these types of land applications. 
The Redevelopment Project Area is well situated within the broader community. It is located near 
the city's central business district and in proximity to an excellent regional surface transportation 
network. The Dan Ryan Expressway (Interstate 90194) is located less than a mile east of the 
Redevelopment Project Area with access points at both 35th Street and Pershing Road. Through 
the use of Pershing Road, 31st Street, 35th Street, Ashland Avenue, and Daman Avenue, the 
Stevenson (Interstate 55) and the Eisenhower (Interstate 290) expresswa~ are located within two 
to four miles, respectively, from the Redevelopment Project Area. 
The major local access routes serving the Redevelopment Project Area include Pershing Road, 
31st Street, 35th Street, Halsted Street, and Ashland Avenue. Additionally, the Redevelopment 
Project Area is well served by public transportation making the site easily accessible to the local 
work force. The CTA maintains a station nearby at 35th Street on the rapid transit line that runs 
along the Dan Ryan Expressway, and at Archer Avenue and Halsted Street along the southwest 
rapid transit line. Also, public transportation is available via CTA buses along Pershing Road, 31st 
Street, 35th Street, Halsted Street, and Ashland Avenue. 
While the Redevelopment Project Area has certain assets, its liabilities are significant and have 
inhibited the area's overall redevelopment (Exhibit 1 ). Much of the Redevelopment Project Area is 
characterized by: 
• 
vacant land; 
• 
vacant buildings, many of which are obsolete due to their old age and design (i.e., multi-
story/single-user); 
• 
outmoded platting; 
• 
excessive building bulk and density on some parcels;

• 
incompatible land uses; 
• 
underutilized property; 
• 
inadequate infrastructure; 
• 
poor property maintenance; and/or 
• 
unused or abandoned railroad rights-of-way. 
Consequently, much of the Redevelopment Project Area is in need of redevelopment and/or 
revitalization. Through the assembly of property and the use of public incentives, large-scale 
redevelopment and revitalization can be achieved. 
Recognizing the redevelopment potential of the Redevelopment Project Area, the City of Chicago 
is taking action to facilitate its revitalization. The City recognizes that the trend of physical 
deterioration, obsolescence, depreciation and other blighting influences will continue to weaken the 
Redevelopment Project Area unless the City itself becomes a leader and a partner with the private 
sector in the revitalization process. 
Consequently, . the City wishes to encourage private 
development activity by using tax increment financing as a prime implementation tool. 
The purpose of this Redevelopment Plan is to create a mechanism to allow for the development of 
new residential, industrial, commercial, and mixed-use facilities on existing vacant or underutilized 
land; the redevelopment and/or expansion of existing viable businesses and industries; and the 
rehabilitation of existing property. The redevelopment of the Redevelopment Project Area is 
expected to encourage economic revitalization within the community and the surrounding area. 
A. AREA HISTORY 
The Redevelopment Project ·Area is situated within two of Chicago's 77 community areas. The 
portion east of the Chicago River is located within Bridgeport which is bounded by the Chicago River 
on the north, the C. & W.l. railroad right-of-way on the east. Pershing Road on the south, and the 
Chicago River on the west The portion located west of the Chicago River is part of the McKinley 
Park community area which is bounded by the SteYenson Expressway (Interstate 55) on the north, 
the Chicago River on the east, Pershing Road on the south, and the B. & O.C.T. railroad right-of· 
way on the west 
The early development of both of these communities was influenced primarily by the completion of 
the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848, the Union Stock Yards in 1865, and the Central 
Manufacturing District in 1908 and 1916. The industrial, residential, commercial, and institutional 
land use patterns currently reflected within the Redevelopment Project Area are representative of 
the development patterns that were established early on. 
The industrial uses are still concentrated south of 35th Street between Halsted and Ashland in the 
area of the original CMO which was bounded by 35th Street on the north, Morgan Street on the 
east, Pershing Road on the south, and AshJand Avenue on the west Commercial uses are stilt

centered along Halsted Street in the vicinity of 35th Street, and the residential community is still 
located north of 35th Street. 
Bddgeport 
According to the 1980 Local Community Fact Book, Bridgeport became a boomtown in 1848 as a 
result of the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal which linked the City of Chicago with the 
Mississippi River. 
Canal-related industries and businesses flocked to the area which was 
conveniently located near this·water transportation route. As stated in the Local Community Fact 
Book, "The chief industry was meat-slaughtering which utilized the ready supply of water in the 
slaughtering process. • 
According to Chicago's Pride: The Stockyards, Packingtown, and Environs in the Nineteenth 
Century, "The vast majority of the packinghouses in the late 1860's were located on the southern 
bank of the South Branch and they dominated life in BridgeJ)ort. • With the advent of the Union Stock 
Yards, the meat packers moved south and west of the yards, encouraged by improved railroad 
facilities in these locations. 
As a result of these early developments, residential and commercial areas grew within the 
Bridgeport community. By the late 1800's, a small shopping district emerged at the intersection of 
35th and Halsted. By the end of the 19th century, according to the Local Community Fact Book, •. 
. . an electric trolley system was introduced in the area, streets were paved, and other public 
improvements made. • 
By the earty 1900's, the Bridgeport community's industrial base expanded to include part of the CMD 
which was the first planned industrial development in the United States. According to the Urban 
Land Institute's Industrial Development Handbook. the development was spearheaded by 
representatives of the Union Stock Yard and Transit Company to attract additional freight for the 
company's belt rail line which served the Union Stock Yards. 
The author of Chicago: City of Neighborhoods states that •1n 1902, a group of investors headed by 
Frederick H. Prince began to buy up land north of the Union Stock Yards. The Prince interests had 
earlier purchased the Union Stock Yard & Transit Company and its belt line railroad, the Chicago 
Junction Railway .•. In 1905 'he announced plans for a new Central Manufacturing District (CMD) 
... The new real estate development proved to be a pioneering effort. The Original East District, 
along 35th Street and east of Ashland Avenue, was an immediate success. In 1912, the William 
Wrigley Company moved its chewing gum factory to 35th and Ashland Avenue in the CMD ... By 
1915 other thriving industries had filled the original265-acre development A former cabbage patch 
and lumber yard had been turned into a major industrial complex by the time World War I broke out 
in the summer of 1914. • 
The Union Stock Yards, packing houses, and the CMD were an important source of employment 
for Bridgeport. Back of the Yards and other south side residents. The railroads which served the

various factories and packing houses also employed many community residents. However, by the 
late sixties and early seventies, this once strong industrial center was in decline. To revitalize the 
area, the City of Chicago initiated many public improvements to support revitalization in the former 
Union Stock Yards Area creating the Stockyards Industrial Park. Those city efforts included the use 
of tax increment financing to facilitate redevelopment. 
McKiolev park 
McKinley Park is located directly west of Bridgeport and is situated northWest. of the old Union Stock 
Yards site. McKinley Park was originally settled by laborers working on the Illinois and Michigan 
canal. The author of Chicago: City of Neighborhoods states that "The area quickly developed from 
a small farming community to an industrial center as Chicago reached out from its origins at the 
mouth of the river to transform its immediate hinterland. • 
According to the 1980 Local Community Fact Book, signtficant development of McKinley Park did 
not occur until 1 863 when it was incorporated into the limits of the City of Chicago. Once the Union 
Stock Yards opened in 1 865, workers were attracted to the community. However, the community 
did not experience rapid growth until the 1880's and 1890's. 
By the tum of the century, most McKinley Park residents were employed in the meatpacking 
industry. Later employment opportunities were available as a result of the development of the CMD 
bounded by 35th Street on the north, Morgan Street on the east, Pershing Road on the south, and 
Ashland Avenue on the west 
Because of the success of the original CMD development site (the East District), a new area was 
developed (the Pershing Road District) in 1916 along the south side of Pershing Road between 
Ashland and Western Avenues. According to Chicago: City of Neighborhoods, "The new buildings 
stood on land bordering the Chicago Junction Railway's classification yards. This was crucial 
because all CMD tenants agreed to use the railroad for their products. One of the major tenants of 
the development along Pershing Road •.. was the United States Army, which took up residence 
in October 1921 ... [and] remained at this site until 1961. • 
By the 1920's, McKinley Park had a stable industrial and residential base. However, like the rest 
of the Stock Yards area, McKinley Park suffered from the loss of jobs in the meatpacking industry 
and the general decline of the CMO. 
Central Manufacturing Qistrict 
In addition to the Union Stock Yards, the CMD greatly Influenced the development of the Bridgeport 
and McKinley Park communities as weU as that of the Redevelopment Project Area. As stated 
previously, the original East District and the Pershing Road District of the CMD were located within 
the boundaries of the Redevelopment Project Area. Uke the UniOn Stock Yards, the CMD was an

than the 260-acre Original East District, the Pershing Road District had several uniQue features: 
• 
a central power unit to provide steam and electric current for light, heat, and 
power to serve the entire tract: 
• 
a central sprinkler system to protect all structures in the tract and to avoid 
unsightly tanks: 
•

standardiZed structural design based on the minimum height of six stories 
and basement, complete with plumbing, light heat, and sprinkler systems, 
and high-speed elevators; 
• 
underground traffic system with concrete tunnels which supplemented 
surface facilities by connecting all buildings with each other and with the 
central freight station, and which provided fast, safe transport of goods and 
materials; and 
• 
underground utility system of concrete tunnels which conveyed utilities from 
the central power unit to all plants, to avoid unsightly surface access'Ories." 
1 n addition to these uniQue features, the Pershing Road District included a mile of frontage on 
Pershing Road with the buildings oriented toward the roadway, and it overlooked beautiful McKinley 
Park. According to the Industrial Development Handbook, these locational characteristics were 
forerunners of trends developed several decades later in the site planning of modern industrial parks. 
D. AREA PROFILE 
The Study Area continues to' reflect the development and economic influences of the Union Stock 
Yards and the CMD as evidenced by its current land uses and demographics. 
Land Use and Zonjng Cbaracteristk;$ 
Currently, the primary land uses within the Study Area includes industrial, residential, commercial, 
institutional, vacant land, and railroad rights-of-way. Generally, the property in the Study Area 
located north of 35th Street is characteriZed by lower intensity residential, limited commercial and 
scattered industrial uses. while the property south of 35th Street is distinguished by higher intensity 
industrial uses. 
According to historical accounts, the area north of 35th Street generally included residential and 
commercial uses with some industrial actiVity concentrated along the riverfront. The commercial

Land Use and Zonjng Cha@ctedstics 
Currently, the pdmary land uses within the Redevelopment Project Area include industrial, 
residential, commercial, institutional, vacant land, and railroad rights-ot-way. Generally. the property 
in the Redevelopment Project Area located north of 35th Street is charactedzed by lower intensity 
residential, limited commercial and scattered industrial uses, while the property south of 35th Street 
is distinguished by higher intensity industrial uses. 
According to historical accounts, the area north of 35th Street generally included residential and 
commercial uses with some industrial activity concentrated along the riverfront The commercial 
uses were concentrated along Halsted Street. in the vicinity of 35th Street The residential uses were 
scattered about the area. Generally, this same type of land use pattern still exists today. 
As mentioned previously, most of the southern portion of the Redevelopment Project Area was the 
site of the CMD including the Original East District and th' Pershing Road District. This portion is 
still traversed by railroad spurs as in the earty 1900's, some of which are situated in the same 
locations. Some of the original users attracted to the CMD are still present today. 
Given the size and diversity of the Redevelopment Project Area, its zoning is varied. The 
predominantly industrial and institutional areas are generally zoned for general manufacturing to 
heavy manufacturing uses (M2·3, M2-4, M3-5) or motor freight terminal uses (C-4). The residential 
areas are generally zoned for multiple family housing {R3, R4). The zoning for the commercial 
areas is varied and includes restricted service districts (84-2), general service districts (B5·3), 
restricted retail districts (B2·1 ), local retail districts (B1·1, B1·2), general retail districts (B3·2, B3·3), 
restricted commercial districts (C1·2, C1-4), and general commercial districts {C2·2,C2-3). 
Demographic and Statistical Cha@cteristjcs 
A variety of demographic and other statistical data were collected for the general area in which the 
Redevelopment Project Area is located. The Census of Population and Housing data for 1980 and 
1990 were compiled by the Chicago Area Geographic Information Study (CAGIS) of the University 
of Illinois at Chicago (Exhibits 2 and 3), and only reflect the census tracts which comprise the 
sections of the Redevelopment Project Area that contain residents. These census tracts include 
6008,6009, 6013,6014 in the Bridgeport community area which is bounded by the Chicago River 
on the north, the C.&W.I. railroad right-of-way on the east, Pershing Road on the south, and the 
Chicago River on the west; and 5907 which is part of the McKinley Park community area that is 
bounded by the Stevenson Expressway on the north, the Chicago River on the east. Pershing Road 
on. the south, and the B. & 0. railroad right-of-way on the west. 
In addition to the population and housing data. selected economic data were· collected for the 
community areas in which the Redevelopment Project Area lies. and primarily reflect information 
compiled by the Woodstock Institute in its Focusing In report published in 1993.

Population and Housing Characteristics 
• 
According to the census tract data. the population within the selected area 
declined slightly by 0.3% from 11,614 persons in 1980 to 11,582 persons in 
1990. The Bridgeport community area experienced a greater population decline 
of 3.4% while the McKinley Park community area's population increased slightly 
by0.4%. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The total number of housing units within these census tracts decreased by 1.1% 
from 4,914 units in 1980 to 4,858 units in 1990. During this time period, the 
Bridgeport community area experienced a decline of 2.5% while the McKinley 
Park community area's housing decreased by 2.0%. 
Most of the population residing within these census tracts in 1980 (63.7%) and 
1990 (62.2%) were renters rather than owners. In 1980, 63.7% of the occupied 
housing units were rented rather than owned. In 1990, this figure was 62.2%. 
This trend was reflected in the Bridgeport community area where 57.4% of the 
occupied housing units were rented in comparison to 60.8% in 1980. The 
McKinley Park community experienced a higher percentage of owner occupancy. 
In 1980, only 51.2% of the occupied housing units were rented. By 1990, this 
percentage decreased to 49.2%. 
Of the vacant buildings identified within these census tracts, 71.0% of them were 
identified as unused in 1990. In 1980, this figure was only 32.4%. The vacancy 
rate for these census tracts has increased from 9.2% in 1980 to 1 0.2% in 1990. 
This is higher than the vacancy rates for the broader community areas. For 
Bridgeport, the vacancy rate increased from 7.7% in 1980 to 8.8% in 1990. In 
the McKinley Park community area, the vacancy rate increased from 7.0% in 
1980 to 8.6% in 1990. 
In 1990, almost haH of the population (44.8%) residing in these census tracts 
were either unemployed or not in the labor force. In 1980, the percentage figure 
was 46.4%. Of the employed persons identified in 1990, the majority of them 
were employed in administrative support, service, or operator/fabricator/laborer 
occupations in the retail trade and manufacturing industries. 
Economic Characteristics 
• 
According to residential lending data, the Bridgeport and McKinley Park 
community areas experienced a decrease in home improvement and FHA/VA 
loans during the period of time from 1983 and 1984 to 1991 and 1992. 
Bridgeport experienced a decrease of 24.9% and 25.8%, respectively, during this 
time period while McKinley Park exhibited a decline of 17.6% and 21.1 %. Both

community areas experienced increases in conventional and multifamily 
residential loans for this time period. 
• 
In addition to the decrease in certain types of residential lending, residential 
building permits for repairs and improvements declined within Bridgeport and 
McKinley Park from the period of time from 1977 and 1981 to 1988 and 1992. 
Bridgeport experienced a 9.6% decline while McKinley Park exhibited a decrease 
of 6.8%. However, residential building permits for new construction increased 
within both community areas, from 67 to 155 in (131.3%) in Bridgeport and from 
three to 16 (~3.3%) in McKinley Park for this same time period.

Summary 
While new residential construction increased in Bridgeport and McKinley Park 
during the period from 1977 and 1981 to 1988 and 1992, the new construction 
of commercial and industrial buildings declined in both community areas. 
Bridgeport experienced a decline of 11.1% while McKinley Park experienced a 
decrease of 50.0% tor this time period. 
Commercial lending by municipal depositories decreased in the Bridgeport 
community area from 0.2% in 1987 to 0.15% in 1991 with the Bridgeport 
community area dropping in rank, by total funds lent, from 30 to 37. For this 
same time period, commercial lending in McKinley Park by municipal 
depositories generally remained constant at approximately 0.1% although the 
McKinley Park community area decreased in rank, by total funds lent, from 41 in 
1987 to 43 in 1991. 
According to employment data tabulated by zip code from 1975 to 1990, the 
Pilsen zip code area (60608) which is bounded by Roosevelt Road on the north, 
Halsted Street on the east, 35th Street on the south, California Avenue on the 
west, and encompasses most of the Redevelopment Project Area, experienced 
a decline in total employment of 15.7% which was greater than that of the City 
as a whole which experienced a decline of only 4.4%. During this time period, 
manufacturing empfoyrnent decreased by 19.8% in the 60608 zip code area. 
Retail employment increased slightly by 5.0% for this zip code area which 
lnctudes commercial districtS outside of. the Redevelopment Project Area such 
as Roosevelt Road and 26th Street For all other employment, zip code 60608 
exhibited a decrease of 1 8.1% which parallels the City's experience of a 16.8% 
dectine. 
According to the demographic data collected, the census tracts in which the Redevelopment Project 
Area is located are characterized by a static population and housing base with little change having 
occurred between 1980 and 1990. During this time period, the housing vacancy rata has increased 
as has the number of vacant properties that were identified as unused. Additionally, almost half

(44.8%) of the work-age population residing within these census tracts were unemployed or not in 
the labor force in 1990; a condition that has remained static as evidenced by the 1980 figure of 
46.4%. 
The broader area in which the Redevelopment Project Area lies also evidenced 
corresponding characteristics as reflected by decreases in population, housing, certain types of 
residential lending, the construction of new commercial and industrial buildings, and employment 
during the 1980s. 
C. TAX INCREMENT ALlOCAnON REDEVELOPMENT ACT 
An analysis of conditions within this area indicates that it is appropriate for designation as a 
Redevelopment Project Area, under the State of Illinois Tax Increment Financing legislation. The 
Redevelopment Project Area is characterized by conditions which warrant its designation as a 
vacant and an improved "Blighted Area" within the definitions set forth in the Tax Increment 
Allocation Redevelopment Act (hereafter referred to as the • Act"). The Act is found in 65 ILCS 5111· 
74.4-1 et seq., as amended. 
The Act provides a means for municipalities, after the approval of a "Redevelopment Plan and 
Project, • to redevelop a blighted conservation area and industrial park of at least 1.5 acres by 
pledging the increase in tax revenues generated by public and private redevelopment This increase 
in tax revenues is used to pay for up-front public costs which are required to stimulate the private 
investment in new redevelopment and rehabilitation. Municipalities may issue obligations to be 
repaid from the stream of real property tax increments that occur within the tax increment financing 
district 
The property tax increment revenue is calculated by determining the difference between the initial 
Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) or the 'Certified EAV Base' for all real estate located within the 
district and the current year EAV. The EAV Is the assessed value of the property multiplied by the 
state multiplier. Any increase in EAV is then multiplied by the current tax rate, which determines the 
incremental real property tax. 
The 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project Area Tax Increment Finance Redevelopment Plan and 
Project (the "Redevelopment Plan") has been formulated in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act It is a guide to all proposed public and private action in the Redevelopment Project Area. In 
addition to describing the objectives of redevelopment, the Redevelopment Plan sets forth the 
overall program to be undertaken to accomplish these objectives. 
This program is the 
Redevelopment Plan and Project. 
This Redevelopment Plan also specifically describes the Redevelopment Project Area. This area 
meets the eligibility requirements of the Act (see 35th/Halstad Tax Increment Finance Program • 
Eligibility Study). The Redevelopment Project Area boundaries are described in the Introduction of 
the Redevelopment Plan and shown in Map 1, Redevelopment Project Boundary. 
After approval of the Redevelopment Plan, the City Council will then formally designate the 
Redevelopment Project Area.

1. 
On a coordinated rather than a piecemeal basis to ensure that the land-use,

2. 
On a reasonable, comprehensive and integrated basis to ensure that blighting 
factors are eliminated; and 
3. 
Within a reaso!"able and defined time period. 
Revitalization of the Redevelopment Project Area is a large and complex undertaking and presents 
challenges and opportunities commensurate to its scale. The success of this effort will depend to 
a large extent on the cooperation between the private sector and agencies of local government. 
The City of Chicago by the approval of this Redevelopment Plan finds that the Redevelopment Plan 
conforms to the Comprehensive Plan or that as a city with a population of 1 00,000 or more, 
regardless of when the Redevelopment Plan and Project was adopted, the Redevelopment Plan 
and Project either. (i) conforms to the strategic economic development or redevelopment plan issued 
by the designated planning authority of the municipality, or (ii) includes land uses that have been 
approved by the planning commission of the municipality. 
There has been no major investment in the Redevelopment Project Area for at least the last five 
years. The adoption of the Redevelopment Plan will make possible the implementation of a logical 
program to stimulate redevelopment in the Redevelopment Project Area, an area which cannot 
reasonably be anticipated to be developed without the adoption of this Redevelopment Plan. Public 
investments will create the appropriate environment to attract the investment required for the 
rebuilding of the area But for the investment of seed funds by the City, the proposed developments 
would not be financially feasible and would not go forward. 
Successful implementation of the Redevelopment Plan and Project requires that the City of Chicago 
take full advantage of the real estate tax increments attributed to the Redevelopment Project Area 
as provided in accordance with the Act.

IV. SUGHTED AREA CONDmONS EXJSnNG 
IN THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA 
The Act states that a "blighted area" means any improved or vacant area within the boundaries of 
a Redevelopment Area located within the territorial limits of the municipality where, if improved, 
industrial, commercial and residential buildings or improvements, because of a combination of five 
or more of the following factors: age; dilapidation; obsolescence; deterioration; illegal use of 
individual structures; presence .of structures below minimum code standards; 'excessive vacancies: 
overcrowding of structures and community facilities; lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities: 
inadequate utilities; excessive land coverage; deleterious land use or layout: depreciation of physical 
maintenance; or lack of community planning, are detrimental to the public safety, health, morals or 
welfare; or, if vacant. the sound growth of the taxing districts is impaired by (1) a combination of two 
or more of the following factors: obsolete platting of the vacant land; diversity of ownership of such 
land; tax and special assessment delinquencies on such 1and; deterioration of structures or site 
improvements in neighboring areas adjacent to the vacant land, or (2) the area immediately prior 
to becoming vacant qualified as a blighted improved area, or (3) the area consists of an unused 
quarry or unused quarries, or (4) the area consists of unused rail yards, rail tracks or railroad rights-
of-way, or (5) the area, prior to its designation, is subject to chronic flooding which adversely impacts 
on real property in the area and such flooding is substantially caused by one or more improvements 
in or in proximity to the area which improvements have been in existence for at least five years, or 
(6) the area consists of an unused disposal site, containing earth, stone, building debris or similar 
material, which was removed from construction, demolition, excavation or dredge sites, or (7) the 
area is not less than 50 nor more than 1 00 acres and 75% of which is vacant. notwithstanding the 
fact that such area has been used for commercial agricultural purposes within five years prior to the 
designation of the redevelopment project area, and which area meets at least one of the factors 
itemized in provision (1) above, and the area has been designated as a town or village center by 
ordinance or comprehensive plan adopted prior to January 1 , 1982, and the area has not been 
developed for that designated purpose. 
Based upon surveys, site inspdons, research and analysis by Louik/Schneider & Associates, Inc .• 
the Redevelopment Project Area qualifies as a vacant and improved Blighted Area as defined by 
the Act; it contains areas that are both vacant and improved. Vacant land exists throughout the 
Redevelopment Project Area in small parcets or groups of parcels •. These parcels because of their 
dispersed nature and small size were considered part of the improved portion of the Redevelopment 
Project Area. However, large tracts of vacant land and unused land also exist These tracts of land 
were reviewed under the vacant land provisions of the Act 
A separate report entiUed "City of Chicago 35th1Halsted Tax Increment Financing Program Eligibility 
Study," dated July 9, 1996, describes in detail the surveys and analyses undertaken and the basis 
for the finding that the Redevelopment Project Area qualifies as a vacant and improved Blighted 
Area as defined by the Act The majority of the Redevelopment Project Area is characterized by the

presence of vacant or improved area blighted eligibility factors listed in the Act for a Blighted Area. 
Summarized below are the findings of the Eligibility Report. 
SUMMARY OF VACANT SUGHTED AREA EUGIBIUTY FACTORS 
The largest single tract of vacant land within the Redevelopment Project Area is located between 
31 st Place on the north, just north of 34th Place on the south, Benson Street/33rd Street/Racine 
Avenue on the west and the South Fork of the South Branch of the Chicago R1ver on the east This 
portion of the Redevelopment Project Area contains 21 vacant contiguous parcels covering four full 
and partial blocks and containing 29 acres of vacant land. 
This part of the Redevelopment Project Area qualifies as a vacant Blighted Area because it 
evidences a combination of two or more of the following vacant blighted area eligibility factors: 
• 
obsolete platting of the vacant land 
• 
diversity of ownership of such land 
• 
tax and special assessment delinquencies on such land 
• 
flooding on all or part of such vacant land 
• 
deterioration of structures or site improvements in neighboring areas adjacent to the vacant land 
Of these factors, the vacant portion of the Redevelopment Project Area exhibits: 1) obsolete platting; 
and 2}diversity of ownership. 
1 • OBSOLETE PLAmNG OF VACANT LAND 
The vacant portion of the Study Area consists of 21 tax parcels which contain a total of 21 
lots. Only one parcel is of sufficient size for contemporary industrial uses; however it is of 
trapezoidal shaped. The second parcel is a very small and almost square parcel of 
approximately 1 0,000 square feet The last parcel is an L-shaped parcel which makes 
industrial development extremely unlikely to occur. 
Therefore, obsolete platting is a factor 
within the vacant portion of the Study Area. 
2. DIVERSITY OF OWNERSHIP OF VACANT LAND 
Diversity of ownership is present in the vacant area. Of the 21 parcels, there are seven 
multiple property owners. The number of different owners would impeded the ability of a 
developer to assemble the land for development meeting contemporary development 
standards. 
In addition to these vacant blighted area eligibility criteria, the vacant portion of the Redevelopment 
Project Area also qualifies as a vacant blighted area under the criteria that 1 ) the area consists of 
unused rail yards, rail tracks or railroad rights-of-way, and 2) the area consists of an unused disposal 
site containing debris from construction demolition, excavation or dredge sites. Of these criteria, 
only one needs to be significanUy present in the vacant area to qualify as a vacant blighted area.

1. THE AREA CONSISTS OF UNUSED RAIL YARDS, RAIL TRACKS OR RAILROAD RIGHTS-of=.WAY. 
The vacant portion of the Study Area is a former railyard. There are numerous rail rights-of-way 
that run through the center of the vacant area. 
2. THE AREA CONSISTS OF UNUSED DISPOSAL SITE CONTAINING DEBRIS FROM CONSTRUCTION DEMOUTlON, 
EXCAVAnON, OR DREDGE SITES. 
The vacant area of the Study Area is covered with debris and construction materials, and is 
engulfed with waste resul~ng from fly-dumping. 
SUMMARY OF IMPROVED 8UGHTED AREA EUGIBIUTY FACTORS 
Ten improved blighted area eligibility criteria are present in a varying degree throughout the 
Redevelopment Project Area. 
The conclusions of each of the factors that are present within the Redevelopment Project Area are 
summarized below. 
1. AGE 
Age, as reflected by buildings 35 years or older, is present throughout the Study Area. Of the 
720 buildings located within the Study Area, 642 of them or 89% are 35 years or older. Age is 
present to a major extent in 59 of the 61 blocks, and present to a minor extent in 1 of the 61 
blocks. 
2. 
DaLAPIDAnoN 
Dilapidation, an advanced state of disrepair of buildings and improvements, is present 
throughout the Study Area. This factor is present to a major extent in 53 of the 61 blocks, 
present to a minor extent in 1 0 of the 61 blocks, and exhibited in 297 of the 720 buildings located 
within the Study Area. 
3. OBSOLESCENCE 
Obsolescence, both functional and economic, is present throughout the Study Area. This factor 
is present to a major extent in 34 of the 61 blocks, and present to a minor extent in 17 of the 61 
blocks. Within the Study Area, many parcels are of Inappropriate size or shape, public 
improvements such as alleys and street widths are inadequate, and structures are incapable 
of efficient or economic use according to contemporary standards. 
4. DETERIORATION 
Deterioration Is present in structures with physical deficiencies or site improvements requiring 
major treatment or repair. This factor is present to a major extent in 57 of the 61 blocks, present 
to a minor extent in 3 of the 61 blocks, and exhibited in 635 of the 720 structures located within 
the Study Area.

5. PRESENCE OF STRUCTURES BELOW MINIMUM CODE STANDARDS 
Structures below minimum code standards are present to a limited extent in 16 of the 61 blocks 
within the Study Area. Of the 720 buildings located in the Study Area. 26 of them were identified 
as being below minimum code standards. 
6. 
ExCESSIVE VACANCIES 
Excessive vacancy is a factor throughout the Study Area. Excessive. vacancies. including 
completely and partially vacant structures, are present to a major extent in 22 of the 61 blocks, 
and present to a minor extent in 26 of the 61 blocks. 
7. OVERCROWDING OF STRUCTURES AND COMMUNITY FACILmES 
Overcrowding of structures and community facilities is present to a very limited extent in the 
Study Area; it is present in 1 of the 61 blocks. 
8. lACK OF VEHnLAnON, LIGHT OR SANITARY FACILmES 
Structures in the Study Area eXhibiting inadequate ventilation or light are those with no windows 
or having boarded-up windows. This factor is present to a major extent in 15 of the 61 blocks, 
and present to a minor extent in 22 of the 61 blocks. ·Based on exterior building surveys, 178 
of the 720 buildings in the Study Area were identified as having inadequate ventilation or light. 
9. INADEQUATE ununES 
Evidence of inadequate utilities is present to a minor extent in 16 of the 61 blocks located within 
the Study Area. 
1 0. ExcESSIVE LAND COVERAGE 
Excessive land coverage, manifested by the over-intensive use of property and the crowding of 
buildings and accessory facilities onto a site, is present throughout the Study Area. The factor 
is eXhibited to a major extent in 32 of the 61 blocks, and present to a minor extent in 20 of the

11. DELETERIOUS LAND USE OF LAYOUT 
Deleterious land uses include all instances of incompatible land use relationships, buildings 
occupied by inappropriate mixed uses, or uses which may be considered noxious, offensive, or 
environmentally unsuitable. Deleterious layout is evidenced by the improper or obsolete platting 
of land, inadequate street layout, and parcels of inadequate size or shape to meet contemporary 
development standards. This factor is present to a major extent in 45 of the 61 blocks, and 
present to a minor extent in 8 of the 61 blocks within the Study Area. 
12. DEPRECIAnoN OF PHYSJCAL MAINTENANCE 
Depreciation of physical maintenance, manifested by substantial deferred maintenance and lack 
of maintenance of buildings, parking areas and streets, is present to a major extent in all of the

• 
All portions of the vacant area of the Redevelopment Project Area are impacted by 
one or the other of the three blighting factors for vacant land. 
• 
Of the 14 factors for an improved Blighted Area set forth in the law, 1 0 are present 
in the Redevelopment Project Area and only five are necessary for designation as 
a Blighted Area. 
• 
The improved -blighted area factors which are present are reasonably 
distributed throughout the improved portion of the Redevelopment 
Project Area. 
• 
All improved areas within the Redevelopment Project Area show the 
presence of improved blighted area factors: 
All blocks in the Redevelopment Project Area evidence the presence of some eligibility factors. The 
eligibility findings indicate that the Redevelopment Area is blighted and in need of revitalization and 
that designation as a redevelopment area will contribute to the long-term well being of the City. All 
factors indicate that the area on the whole has not been subject to growth and development through 
investments by private enterprise, and will not be developed without action by the City. 
The analysis above was based upon data assembled by Louik/Schneider & Associates, Inc.,

V. 35TH/HALSTED REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AND PROJECT 
A. GENERAL lAND USE PLAN 
The Land Use Plan identifies the proposed land uses that will be in effect upon adoption of this 
Redevelopment Plan (Map 3) .. The major land use categories for the Redevelopment Project Area 
incJude commercial, residential, industrial, and mixed-uses. The location of all major thoroughfares 
and major street rights-of-way are subject to change and modification as specific redevelopment 
projects are undertaken. 
This Redevelopment Plan and the proposed projects described herein will be approved by the 
Chicago Plan Commission prior to the adoption of this RedeVelopment Plan, and are consistent with 
the City's Corridors of Opportunity: A Plan for Industry in Chicago's South Side. The general land 
uses proposed tor the Redevelopment Project Area are described by subarea. 
HALSTED STREET SUBAREA 
The Halsted Street subarea is bounded by 31st Street on the north, the alley between Halsted Street 
and Emerald Avenue on the east, 37th Street on the south, and the alley between Halsted and 
Green Streets and on the west (Map 3). It encompasses a long-established neighbomood shopping 
district that originally developed in the late 1800's. The predominant land uses within this subarea 
are ground floor commercial and upper floor residential. It is characterized by vacant storefronts, 
scattered vacant buildings and parcels, small lots, limited off-street parking, and the lack of 
commercial continuity among the ground floor uses. Additionally, the volume and speed of traffic 
along Halsted Street impacts a shopper's ability to easily cross the street 
While this subarea reflects certain blighting characteristics, It continues to be well suited for 
commercial and residential development based on existing land use patterns, the availability of 
vacant and underutillzed properties suitable for commercial/residential rehabilitation, and its 
adjacency to a stable neighbomood. Consequently, this subarea is designated to accommodate 
primarily convenience-type commercial and upper floor residential uses. 
MORGAN STREET SUBAREA 
The Morgan Street subarea includes all property fronting on Morgan Street between 31st Street on 
the north and 35th Street on the south, and au property fronting the south side of 35th Street 
between Morgan Street on the west and the alley between Utuanica Avenue and Halsted Street on 
the east (Map 3).

Currently, the primary land use along Morgan Street is residential although, in the past, it was 
dominated by commercial uses. 
Uke the Halsted Street shopping district, Morgan Streets 
commercial base has shrunk as a result of the overall area's changing economic base. This section 
of the subarea is characterized by scattered vacant buildings, and aging infrastructure. Additionally, 
the use of Morgan Street as a vehicular bypass to the Halsted Street commercial area results in high 
speed through traffic that presents a conflict with residential uses. The primary land uses along 35th 
Street within the subarea include a mix of industrial and residential. Consequently, this portion of 
the subarea is characterized by incompatible land uses. 
While this subarea is in need of certain improvements to stimulate redevelopment, it continues to 
be suited to predominantlY residential uses. It Is envisioned that Morgan Street will be transformed 
into a residential street, and the induStrial uses along 35th Street will be replaced by residential. 
SANGAMON STREET SUBAREA 
The Sangamon Street subarea is generally bounded by 37th Place on the north, the alley between 
Halsted Street and Emerald Avenue on the east, Pershing Road on the south, and Morgan Street 
on the west; and includes the properties fronting on Halsted Street between 37th Street and 37th 
Place as well as the properties fronting on the east side of Morgan Street from the alley between 
35th Street and 35th Place on the north and 37th Place on the south (Map 3). 
Development within this subarea generally has been light industrial in nature with uses supporting 
the heavy industrial activities located in the surrounding area. This subarea has long been a 
transition zone buffering the commercial and residential areas on the north and east from the heavy 
industrial uses on the south and west It is anticipated that the successful redevelopment of this 
subarea will occur relative to the successful redevelopment of the surrounding heavy industrial 
areas. Consequently, redevelopment is anticipated to be targeted toward industrial-support uses. 
MORGAN STREET INDUSTRIAL SUBAREA 
The Morgan Street Industrial subarea is bounded by 35th Street on the north, Morgan Street on the 
east. Pershing Road on the south, and the Chicago River on the west (Map 3). Historically, this 
subarea has consisted of Industrial land uses, and was originally developed, beginning in 1905, as 
an industrial district Its boundaries reflect the boundaries of the eastern half of the Original East 
DistriCt of the CMO. Currently, this subarea Is characterized by inadequate roadway infrastructure, 
a lack of identity, buildings unsuitable for redevelopment for modem industrial uses, and the poor 
condition of some buildings. 
The Morgan Street Industrial subarea continues to be well suited to Industrial development given 
its history as an industrial area, the surrounding land use patterns, its proximity to an excellent 
surface transportation network, and the presence of vacant and underutilized property suitable for

modern industrial park. 
BENSON PARK SUBAREA 
The Benson Park subarea is bounded by 31st Place, Benson Street, 33rd Street, and 34th Place 
on the north; Racine Avenue and the alley between Carpenter and Morgan Streets on the east; 35th 
Street on the south; and the Chicago River on the west (Map 3). Historically, this subarea has been 
dominated by industrial land uses. However, its current primary land uses include vacant land, 
vacant industrial buildings, underutilized parking lots which used to serve the induStrial uses, and 
scattered commercial uses. 
New industrial development within this subarea is unlikely to occur in the future given the subarea's 
constraints which include: 1 ) the limited amount of vacant land available for development in 
comparison to the surrounding area which offers an abundance of opportunities that are better 
suited to modem industrial development, and 2) its adjacency to an established residential 
neighborhood. Consequently, this subarea has been designated for residential development to take 
advantage of its access along the Chicago River and its adjacency to a stable residential 
neighborhood. 
35TH AND ASHLAND SUBAREA 
The 35th and Ashland subarea is bounded by 33rd Street on the north, the Chicago River on the 
east, 35th Street on the south, and Ashland Avenue on the west (Map 3). The predominant land 
uses within this subarea have always been industrial, and inctudect warehouse, trucking, and other 
industrial-oriented uses. Currently, this subarea is characterized by vacant and underutilized 
properties, and incompatible residential development on a limited scale. 
While this subarea exhibits certain blighting characteristics, it has the potential for large-scale 
redevelopment, with the assistance of public improvements or incentives. Given its internal land use 
patterns and its adjacency to other industrial subareas, this subarea has been designated for 
industrial uses. 
37TH AND IRON SUBAREA 
The 37th and Iron subarea is bounded by 35th Street on the north, the Chicago River on the east, 
Pershing Road on the south, and Ashland Avenue on the west (Map 3). This subarea was part of 
the Original East DiStrict of the CentraJ Manufacturing District deyelopment, and has consistently 
accommodated industrial uses. Currently, this subarea is characteriZed by inadequate infrastructure 
in some portions: scattered multistory, old industrial buildings unsuitable for modem industrial uses; 
and scattered vacant land. Given that this subarea is still well suited for industrial development, it

The Halsted Street subarea is bounded by 31st Street on the north, the alley between Halsted Street 
and Emerald Avenue on the east, 37th Street on the south, and the alley between Halsted and 
Green Streets and on the west (Map 2). It is designated primarily for convenience-type commercial 
and upper floor residential uses which is a continuation of the existing dominant land uses. 
This subarea is characterized by vacant storefronts, scattered vacant buildings and parcels, small 
lots, limited off-street parking, and the lack of commercial continuity among the ground floor uses. 
Additionally, the volume and speed of traffic along Halsted Street impacts a shopper's ability to 
easily cross the street With the advent of nearby shopping malls, this neighborhood commercial 
district has declined and its geographic area has decreased. To achieve successful redevelopment, 
improvement of the subarea is necessary.

35th/Halsted ·Redevelopment Plan·-------------------------
has been designated for industrial uses. It is envisioned that this subarea will be transformed into 
a modem industrial park. 
PERSHING ROAD SUBAREA 
The Pershing Road subarea is bounded by Pershing Road on the north, private property on the 
south, the vacated channel of the Chicago River on the south, and private property on the west (Map 
3). This subarea was the site of the Pershing Road District of the CMD, and has always been 
industrial in nature. Currently, this subarea is characterized by several vacant, multistory old 
industrial buildings which may be unsuitable for modem industrial uses, and it lacks parking. While 
this area has redevelopment potential given the amount of existing vacant and underutilized 
property, it is not easily developable due to the costs associated with rehabilitating or demolishing 
the structures. Its chances of being developed for new industrial uses are unknown without further 
study. Consequently, this subarea has been designated for industrial and compatible mixed-uses. 
B. REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AND PROJECT STRATEGIES IY SUBAREA 
For planning and programming purposes, the Redevelopment Project Area is divided into subareas 
based on the similarity and the character of the existing and/or proposed land uses and 
development activities. For each subarea, specific redevelopment objectives addressing private 
actions and public improvements have been identified. Implementation of the Redevelopment Plan 
and Project will be undertaken on a phased basis. 
Within the Redevelopment Project Area, there are eight distinct subareas, each characterized by 
a predominant type of land use. The following table summarizes the subareas by the existing and 
proposed primary land uses.

E. SOURCES OF FUNDS TO PAY REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT COSTS 
Funds necessary to pay for redevelopment project costs are to be derived principally from tax 
increment revenues, proceeds of municipal obligations which are secured principally by tax 
increment revenues and/or possible tax increment revenues from the adjacent TIF Districts. There 
may be. other sources of funds which the City may elect to use to pay for Redevelopment Project 
costs or obligations issued, the proceeds of which will be used to pay for such costs, including but 
not limited to state and federal grants and land disposition proceeds generated from the district. 
The tax increment revenue which may be used to secure municipal obligations or pay for eligible 
Redevelopment Project costs shall be the incremental real property tax revenue. Incremental real 
property tax revenue is attributable to the increase in the current equalized assessed value of each 
taxable lot, block, tract or parcel of real property in the Redevelopment Project Area over and above 
the initial equalized assessed value of each such property in the Redevelopment Project Area. 
Without the use of such tax incremental revenues, the Redevelopment Project Area would not 
reasonably be anticipated to be developed. 
The Stockyards Southeast Quadrant TIF District and the Stockyards CommerciaVlndustrial TIF 
District and the proposed Stockyards Annex Redevelopment Project Area and the proposed 
35th/Halsted Study Area are all contiguous to one another, and the City finds the goals, objectives 
and financial success of such redevelopment project areas to be interdependent. The City further 
finds that it is in the best interests of the City and in furtherance of the purposes of the Act that net 
revenues from each such redevelopment project are made available to support the other. The City 
therefore proposes to utilize net incremental revenues received from one redevelopment project 
area to pay eligible redevelopment project costs, or obligations issued to pay such costs, in the other 
redevelopment project areas, and vice versa. The amount of revenue from the Redevelopment 
Project Area made available to support such contiguous redevelopment project areas, when added 
to all amounts used to pay eligible redevelopment projects costs within the Redevelopment Project 
Area, shall not at any time exceed the total Redevelopment Eligible Project Costs described on 
Table 1 (unless otherwise amended). 
ISSUANCE OF 0BUGAnONS 
To finance Redevelopment Project costs a municipality may issue general obligation bonds or 
obligations secured by the anticipated tax increment revenue generated within the Redevelopment 
Project Area or the City may permit the utilization of guarantees, deposits and other forms of security 
made available by private sector developers to secure such obligations. In addition, a municipality 
may pledge toward payment of such obligations any part or any combination of the following: (a) 
net revenues of all or part of any redevelopment project; (b) taxes levied and collected on any or all 
property in the municipality; (c) the full faith and credit of the municipality; (d) a mortgage on part or 
all of the Redevelopment Project Area; or (e) any other taxes or anticipated receipts that the 
municipality·may lawfully pledge.

All obligations issued by the City pursuant to this Redevelopment Plan and the Act shall be retired 
within 23 years (by the year 2019) from the adoption of the ordinance approving the Redevelopment 
Project Area. Also, the final maturity date of any such obligations which are issued may not be later 
than 20 years from their res~ dates of issue. One or more series of obligations may be sold 
at one or more times in order to implement this Redevelopment Plan. The amounts payable in any 
year as principal and interest on all obligations issued by the City pursuant to the Redevelopment 
Plan and the Act shall not exceed the amounts available, or projected to be available, from tax 
increment revenues and frotn such bond sinking funds or other sources of funds (inctuding ad 
valorem taxes) as may be provided by ordinance. Obligations may be of a parity or senior/junior lien 
natures. Obligations issued maybe serial or term maturities, and may or may not be subject to 
mandatory, sinking fund, or optional redemptions. 
Tax increment revenues shall be used for the scheduled and/or early retirement of obligations, and 
for reserves, bond sinking funds and redevelopment project costs, and, to the extent that real 
property tax increment is not used for such purposes, shall be dectared surplus and shall then 
become available for distribution annually to taxing districts in the Redevelopment Project Area in 
the manner provided by the Act 
F. MOST RECENT EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUATION OF PROPERTIES IN THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
AREA 
The total 1995 equalized assessed valuation for the entire Redevelopment Project Area is 
$80,765,158 (Table 2). After verification by the County Clet1< of Cook County, this amount will serve 
as the •tnitial Equalized Assessed Valuation: 
G. ANTICIPATED EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUATION 
By the year 2019 when it is estimated that development will be completed and fully assessed, the 
estimated equaliZed assessed valuation of real property within the Redevelopment Project Area is 
estimated at between $110,000,000 and $130,000.000. These estimates are based on several key 
assumptions, inctuding: 1 ) aU industrial redevelopment will be completed in 2019; 2) the market 
value of the anticipated developments will increase following completion of the redevelopment ac-
tivities described In the Redevelopment Plan and Project 3) the most recent State Multiplier of 
2.1243 as applied to 1995 assessed values will remain unchanged; 4) for the duration of the project, 
the tax rate for the entire Redevelopment Project Area is assumed to be the same and will remain 
unchanged from the 1995 level; and 5) growth from reassessments of existing properties at a rate 
of 2.0% per year with a reassessment every three years.

H. LACK OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INVESTMENT BY PRfYATE ENTERPRISE 
As described in the Blighted Area Conditions Section of this Redevelopment Plan and Project 
Report, the Redevelopment Project Area as a whole is adversely impacted by the presence of 
numerous factors, and these factors are reasonably distributed throughout the Redevelopment 
Project Area. The Redevelopment Project Area on the whole has not been subject to growth and 
development through investme(lt by private enterprise. The lack of private investment is evidenced 
by continued existence of the factors referenced above and the lack of new development projects 
initiated or completed within the Redevelopment Project Area. 
The lack of growth and investment by the private sector is supported by the trend in the equalized 
assessed valuation ·EAv- of all the property in the Redevelopment Project Area from of 1991·1995. 
The EAV for the Redevelopment Project Area in 1995 and 1991 were $80,765,158 and $69,766,596 
respectively. The EAV increase from 1991 to 1995 represents a 15.76% increase or 3.94% per 
year. This Redevelopment Project Area is comprised primarily of industrial uses along with a 
substantial number of commercial uses and a limited number of mixed commercial residential uses 
which are assessed.as commercial property. The EAV for commercial and industrial property in the 
City of Chicago increased from $7,875,611,000 in 1984 to $16,299,068,000 in 1994 or 104.72% or 
10.47% per year. It also appears that the largest increase in EAV for individual properties came 
from properties which were sold and which remain in the same condition as prior to their sale. 
A review of the building permit requests from the City of Chicago Department of Buildings for the 
518 acre Study Area found 42 permits for new construction/improvements were issued in the last 
5 
years 
totaling $2,518,622 
(see 
Exhibit 5 -
Building 
Permit 
Requests 
-
New 
Construction/Improvements). Of the 42 permits, eight permits representing six buildings totaled 
$1,946,984. 
It is clear from the study of this area that private investment in revitalization and redevelopment has 
not occurred to overcome the Blighted Area conditions .that currently exist. The Redevelopment 
Project Area is not reasonably expected to be developed without the efforts and leadership of the 
City, including the adoption of this Redevelopment Plan and Project.

I. FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
Without the adoption of this Redevelopment Plan and Project, and tax increment financing, the 
Redevelopment Project Area is not reasonably expected to be redeveloped by private enterprise. 
There is a real prospect that the Blighted Area conditions will continue and are likely to spread, and 
the surrounding area will become less attractive for the maintenance and improvement of existing 
buildings and sites. The possibility of the erosion of the assessed value of ..property which would 
result from the lack of a concerted effort by the City to stimulate revitalization and redevelopment 
could lead to a reduction of real estate tax revenue to all taxing districts. 
Sections A, B, & C of this Redevelopment Plan and Project describe the comprehensive 
redevelopment program proposed to be undertaken by the City to create an environment in which 
private investment can occur. The Redevelopment Project will be staged with various developments 
taking place over a period of years. If the Redevelopment Project is successful, various new private 
projects will be undertaken that will assist in alleviating the Blighted Area conditions, which caused 
the Redevelopment Project Area to qualify as a Blighted Area under the Act, creating new jobs and 
promoting development in the Redevelopment Project Area. 
The Redevelopment Project is expected to have short and long term financial impacts on the taxing 
districts affected by the Redevelopment Plan. Curing the period when tax increment financing is 
utilized, real estate tax increment revenues (from the increases in Equal Assessed Valuation [EAV] 
over and above the certified initial EAV established at the time of adoption of this Plan and Project) 
will be used to pay eligible redevelopment project costs for the TIF District. Incremental revenues 
will not be available to these taxing districts during this period. At the end of the period during which 
the Redevelopment Project Area may exist under the Act, the real estate tax revenues will be 
distributed to all taxing districts levying taxes against property located in the Redevelopment Project 
Area. 
J. DEMAND ON TAXING DISTRICT SERVICES 
The following major taxing districts presently levy taxes on properties located within the 
Redevelopment Project Area: City of Chicago; Chicago Board of Education District 299; Chicago 
School Finance Authority; Chicago Park District; Chicago Community College District 508; 
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago; County of Cook; and Cook County 
Forest Preserve District. 
The majority of the proposed Redevelopment Project involves industrial and commercial type 
projects. 
Non-residential development. such as industrial, commercial, office, service, public and institutional 
uses, should not cause increased demand for services or capital improvements on any of the taxing 
districts named above except for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District. Replacement of

vacant and underutilized land with active and more intensive uses will result in additional demands 
on services and facilities provided by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, City of Chicago, 
and the City of Chicago Police and Fire Departments. However, it is expected that any increase in 
demand for treatment of sanitary and storm sewage associated with the Redevelopment Project 
Area can be adequately handled by existing treatment facilities maintained and operated by the 
Metropolitan Water Reclamation DiStrict Additionally, any additional cost to the City of Chicago for 
police, fire protection and sanitation services will be minimal since industrial developments will 
privately pay for the majority ~f the costs of these services (i.e., sanitation services). 
Residential development is not likely to cause increased demand for capital improvements·to be 
provided by the Community College District, Chicago Park District. Metropolitan Water Reclamation 
District and the City of Chicago. Based on the size of the proposed development and the existence 
of several existing neighborhood parks, for example, it is not anticipated that the Park District will 
require any new capital improvements. It Is also expected that any minor increase in demand for 
treatment of sanitary and storm sewage associated with the residential development within the 
Redevelopment Project Area can be adequately handled by existing treatment facilities of the 
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District. Some additional services may be required by the Chicago 
Park District and the City of Chicago for police and fire protection; however, these services are not 
expected to be significant. 
Without the adoption of this Redevelopment Plan and Project, and tax increment financing, the 
Redevelopment Project Area is not reasonably expected to be redeveloped by private enterprise. 
There is a real prospect that the Blighted Area factors will continue to exist and spread, and the 
area as a whole will become less attractive for the maintenance and improvement of existing 
buildings and sites and will become a blighted area. The possibility of the erosion of the assessed 
value of property which would result from the lack of a concerted effort by the City to stimulate 
revitalization and redevelopment could lead to a reduction of real estate tax revenue to all taxing 
districts . 
If successful, the implementation of the Redevelopment Project may enhance the values of 
properties within and adjacent to the Redevelopment Project Area. 
K. PROGRAM TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL AND SEAVJCE IMPACTS 
As described in detail in prior sections of this report, the complete scale and amount of development 
in the Redevelopment Project Area cannot be predicted with complete certainty at this time and the 
demand for services provided by those taxing districts cannot be quantified at this time. 
As indicated in Section D & Table 1, Estimated Redevelopment Project Costs of the Redevelopment 
Plan and Project, the City may provide public improvements and facilities to service the 
Redevelopment Project Area. It is likely that any potential improvements may mitigate some of the

of this Redevelopment Plan and Project. 
L. PROVISION FOR AMENDING ACTION PLAN 
The 
Redevelopment Project Area Tax Increment Redevelopment Plan ,and Project may be 
amended pursuant to the provisions of the Act. 
M. AFF1RMAnvE ACTION PLAN 
The City is committed to and will affirmatively implement the following principles with respect to the 
Redevelopment Project Area. 
· 
A. 
The assurance of equal opportunity in all personnel and employment actions with 
respect to the Redevelopment Plan and Project, including but not limited to hiring, 
training, transfer, promotion, discipline, fringe benefits, salary, employment working 
conditions, termination, etc., without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, 
handicapped status, national origin, creed, or ancestry. 
B. 
Redeveloper will meet City of Chicago standards for participation of Minority 
Business Enterprise and Woman Business Enterprises as required in any 
Redevelopment Agreements with the City. 
c. 
This commitment to affirmative action and non discrimination will ensure that all 
members of the protected groups are sought out to compete for all job openings and 
promotional opportunities. 
N. PHASING AND SCHEDUUNG OF REDEVELOPMENT 
A phased implementation strategy will be utilized to achieve a timely and orderly redevelopment 
of the Redevelopment Project Area. It is expected that over the 23 years of this plan for the 
Redevelopment Project Area, numerous public/private improvements and developments can be 
expected to take place. The specific time frame and financial investment will be staged in a timely 
manner. Development within the Redevelopment Project Area intended to be used for industrial 
purposes will be staged consistently with the funding and construction of infrastructure 
improvements, and private sector interest in new industrial facilities. 
City expenditures for 
Redevelopment Project costs will be carefully staged on a reasonable and proportional basis to 
coincide with expenditures in redevelopment by private developers. 
The estimated date 
forcompletion of the Redevelopment Project shall be no later than 23 years from the adoption of the 
ordinance of the City Council of the City approving the Redevelopment Project Area.
