INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

‘The Honorable Lor E. Lightfoot, Mayor
Members ofthe City Counc
ity of Chicago, ltinois

Opinion

‘We have audited the accompanying financial stalements ofthe 3th Halsted Redevelopment Project ofthe
City f Chicago. llinois, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes to the
financial statements, which colacvely comprise the Project's basic financial statements as listed in the
{abl of content,

In ur opinion, the financial statements reterred to above present fairy, in all material respects, the
respective financial poston ofthe 35tvHalsod Redevelopment Projecto the Cty of Chicago, lias, as of
December 31,2021, and the respective changes in financial postion forthe year then ended in accordance
‘with accounting principles generaly accepted inthe United States of America,

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with ausiting standards generally accepted in the United States of
‘America. Out responsibltes under those standards are further described inthe Auditors Responsibiies
for the Audit ofthe Financial Statements section of our repor. We are required to be independent ofthe
City Chicago, linois, and to meet our other ethical responsibities in accordance wih the relevant ethical
requirements relating fo our aud. We belive thatthe audit evidence we have oblained is sulci and
‘appropriate to provide a basi for our aut opinion,

Emphasis of Mattor

‘As deserved in Not 3, the financial stlements ofthe 25t/Halsted Redevelopment Project, Cty of Chicago,
Minos, are intended to present the ftancial posiion and the changes in financial postion, of oni thal porion
of the special revenue funds of the Gy of Chicago, linois that atrbutable to the transactions of the

{iy of Chicago, linis. as of December 31, 2021 and the changes in ts nancial postion forthe year then
‘ended in accordance wth accounting principles generaly accepted inthe United States of America. Our opinion
'Srot moditied wih respect io ths mater.

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fai presentation of the financial statements in
‘accordance wth accounting principles generaly accepted in the United States of America; and for the
design, implementation, and maintenance of intemal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of nancial statements that are tree from material misstatement, whether du fraud or err.

‘Auditor's Responsibility forthe Audit ofthe Financial Statements

(Our objectives aro to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
{roe trom material misstatement, whether due o fraud or ertor and to sue an auditor's report that includes
‘ur opinion. Reasonable assurance isa high level of assurance buts nol absolute assurance and therefore
is nota guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will
‘lvays detect a material misstatement when it exists, The risk of not detecing a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resuling Irom ertor, as fraud may invalve collusion, forgery,

intentional omissions, misreprsentations, or the override of internal control. Msstatoments are considered
material if there is @ substantial iketinood tha, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the
Judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements,

In pertrming an auit in accordance with generaly accepted auditing standards, we:

‘+ Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the auc

“+ Identity and assess the risks of matrial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
‘raud or err, and design and perform aut procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures
include examining on atest bass, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures inthe financial
statements

“+ Obiain an understanding of internal contro relevant tothe aust inorder to design aualt procedures
that are appropriate in te circumstances, but not fr the purpase of expressing an opinion on the
ctfectivenes ofthe City of Chicago's intemal cantral. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

‘+ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
‘accounting estimates made By management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
‘inancial statements,

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing ofthe audit, significant aut ndings, and certain intemal contro-elaled maters
{hat we idenbied during the aud

Required Supplementary Information

‘Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require thatthe management's
‘discussion and analysis be presented to supplement the basi nancial statements. Such informaton isthe
responsibilty of management ang, although not apart of the basi nancial statements, i aquired by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers i tobe an essential part of nancialreporing
for placing the basc financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic. or historical context. We
have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
‘auditing standards generally accepted inthe Ursted Slates of America, which consisted of inquries of
management about the methods of preparing th information and comparing the information for consistency
with managements responses to our inquires, the basic fnancial statements, and other knowedge we
‘oblained during our aut of the basic financial statements. We do nol express an opinion or provide any
‘assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with suient evidence to
‘express an opinion or provide any assurance.

‘Supplementary Information

comprise the S6thiHalsied Redevelopment Progcts basic financial statements. The Schedule of
Expenditures by Statutory Code is presented for purposes of addtional analysis and is not arequied part

[As management ofthe 35h/Halsted Tax Increment Redevelopment Project Area (Project), we offer the readers of
the Project’ financial statements this naratve overview and analysis of the Project's nancial pertormance fr the
year ended December 31,2021. Please read itn conjuncion withthe Project's nancial statements, which folow
this section,

‘Oveniew ofthe Financial Statements

This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Project's basic financial statements
‘The Project's basic nancial statements include three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2)
governmental fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains
ther supplementary information conceming the Project's expenditures by statutory code.

Basie Financial Statements

‘The basi financial statements include two kinds of financial statements that present diferent views of the
Project - the Government Wide Financial Statements and the Governmental Fund Financial Statements. These
financial statements also include the nots to the financial statements that explain some othe information in the
financial statements and provide more deal

Govemment-Wide Financial Statements

‘The government-wide nancial statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the Projct’s
financial statue and use accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies, The statement
Cf net position includes alo he project's assets and labities. All ofthe current years revenues and expenses,
are accounted for in the statement of actvties regardess of when cash is received or paid. The two
{overment-nde statements report the Project's net postion and how they have changed. Net postion ~ the
Sitlrence between the Project's assets and lables is one way to measure the Project's nancial healt, or
positon,

Govemmental Fund Financial Statements

‘The governmental fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the Projects signiticant
fund ~ not the Projet as a whole. Governmental funds focus on: 1) how cash and other financial assets can
readily be converte fo cash flows and 2) the yearend balances that are available for spending. Consequently,
the governmental und statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine whether there are
‘more financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the Projet. Because this information
does not encompass the addtional long-term focus ofthe government-wide statements, we provide addtional
information atthe bottom of the statements to explain the relationship (or dferences) between them.
