** Depending on the particular goals of this type of program, the City may: i) make an advance disbursement 
of the entire public investment amount to the City's program administrator, ii) disburse the amounts through 
an escrow account, or iii) pay the funds out piecemeal to the program administrator or to the ultimate grantee 
as each ultimate grantee's work is approved under the program.
*** As of the last date of the reporting fiscal year, the construction of this Project was ongoing; the Private 
Investment Undertaken and Ratio figures for this Project will be reported on the Annual Report for the fiscal 
year in which the construction of the Project is completed and the total Private Investment figure is available.
FY 2021
(a) Each actual or estimated Public Investment reported here is, to the extent possible, comprised only of 
payments financed by tax increment revenue, and may include interest amounts paid to finance the Public 
Investment amount. In contrast, each actual or estimated Private Investment reported here is, to the extent 
possible, comprised of payments financed by revenues that are not tax increment revenues and, therefore, 
may include private equity, private lender financing, private grants, other public monies, or other local, state or 
federal grants or loans.
(b) Each amount reported here under Public Investment Undertaken, Total Estimated to Complete Project, is 
the maximum amount of payments financed by tax increment revenue that could be made pursuant to the 
corresponding Project's operating documents, but not including interest that may later be payable on 
developer notes, and may not necessarily reflect actual expenditures, if any, as reported in Section 3 herein.  
The total public investment amount ultimately made under each Project will depend upon the future 
occurence of various conditions, including interest that may be payable on developer notes as set forth in the 
Project's operating documents.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
The Honorable Lori E. Lightfoot, Mayor
Members of the City Council
City of Chicago, Illinois
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project of the
City of Chicago, Illinois, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes to the
financial statements, which collectively comprise the Project’s basic financial statements as listed in the
table of contents.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois, as of
December 31, 2021, and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities
for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the
City of Chicago, Illinois, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical
requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
As described in Note 1, the financial statements of the 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project, City of Chicago,
Illinois, are intended to present the financial position and the changes in financial position, of only that portion
of the special revenue funds of the City of Chicago, Illinois that is attributable to the transactions of the
35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project.  They do not purport to, and do not, present the financial position of the
City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December 31, 2021 and the changes in its financial position for the year then
ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion
is not modified with respect to this matter.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; and for the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
2
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered
material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the
judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:
·
Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
·
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures
include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.
·
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the City of Chicago’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
·
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters
that we identified during the audit.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s
discussion and analysis be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the
responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting
for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We
have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of
management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency
with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we
obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any
assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to
express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project’s basic financial statements. The Schedule of
Expenditures by Statutory Code is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part
of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial
statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the
basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial
statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, such information
is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

35TH/HALSTED REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
(UNAUDITED)
As management of the 35th/Halsted Tax Increment Redevelopment Project Area (Project), we offer the readers of
the Project’s financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the Project’s financial performance for the
year ended December 31, 2021. Please read it in conjunction with the Project’s financial statements, which follow
this section.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Project’s basic financial statements.
The Project’s basic financial statements include three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2)
governmental fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements.  This report also contains
other supplementary information concerning the Project’s expenditures by statutory code.
Basic Financial Statements
The basic financial statements include two kinds of financial statements that present different views of the
Project – the Government-Wide Financial Statements and the Governmental Fund Financial Statements. These
financial statements also include the notes to the financial statements that explain some of the information in the
financial statements and provide more detail.
Government-Wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the Project’s
financial status and use accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies.  The statement
of net position includes all of the project’s assets and liabilities.  All of the current year’s revenues and expenses
are accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid.  The two
government-wide statements report the Project’s net position and how they have changed. Net position – the
difference between the Project’s assets and liabilities – is one way to measure the Project’s financial health, or
position.
Governmental Fund Financial Statements
The governmental fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the Project’s significant
funds – not the Project as a whole.  Governmental funds focus on: 1) how cash and other financial assets can
readily be converted to cash flows and 2) the year-end balances that are available for spending.  Consequently,
the governmental fund statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps determine whether there are
more financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the Project.  Because this information
does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the government-wide statements, we provide additional
information at the bottom of the statements to explain the relationship (or differences) between them.

Notes to the Financial Statements
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the
government-wide and governmental fund financial statements.  The notes to the financial statements follow the
basic financial statements.
Other Supplementary Information
In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents a schedule of
expenditures by statutory code.  This supplementary information follows the notes to the financial statements.
Condensed Comparative Financial Statements
The condensed comparative financial statements are presented on the following page.
Analysis of Overall Financial Position and Results of Operations
Property tax revenue for the Project was $13,304,098 for the year.  This was an increase of 13 percent over the
prior year.
The change in net position (including other financing uses) produced a decrease in net position of
$8,879,745. The Project’s net position decreased by 18 percent from the prior year making available
$32,681,279 (net of surplus distribution) of funding to be provided for purposes of future redevelopment in the
Project’s designated area. Expenses increased this year due to the Project’s formulation of a redevelopment
plan or necessary funding was substantially complete and available.

CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
35TH/HALSTED REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Reporting Entity
In January 1997, the City of Chicago (City) established the 35th/Halsted Tax Increment
Redevelopment Project Area (Project). The area has been established to finance improvements,
leverage private investment and create and retain jobs. The Project is accounted for within the
special revenue funds of the City.
The financial statements present
only the activities of
the
35th/Halsted Tax Increment
Redevelopment Project and do not purport to present the financial position and the changes in
financial position of any other special revenue funds of the City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December
31, 2021 and for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
(b)
Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the Project are based upon accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB).
(c)
Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the statement of
activities) and the governmental fund financial statements (i.e., the balance sheet and the statement
of governmental fund revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balance) report information on the
Project. See Note 1(a).
(d)
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Financial Statements Presentation
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement
focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are
recorded when a liability is incurred regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are
recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied.
The governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting with only current assets and
liabilities included on the balance sheet. Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues
are recorded when susceptible to accrual, i.e., both measurable and available to finance
expenditures of the current period. Available means collectible within the current period or soon
enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current period. Property taxes are susceptible to
accrual and recognized as a receivable in the year levied. Revenue recognition is deferred unless
the taxes are received within 60 days subsequent to year-end. Expenditures are recorded when the
liability is incurred.
Private-sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued prior to December 1, 1989,
generally are followed in government-wide financial statements to the extent that those standards do
not conflict with or contradict guidance of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The City
has elected not to follow subsequent private-sector guidance.

35TH/HALSTED REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
(d)
Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Financial Statements Presentation (Concluded)
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates.
(e)
Assets, Liabilities and Net Position
Cash and Investments
Cash being held by the City is generally deposited with the City Treasurer as required by the
Municipal Code of Chicago. The City Comptroller issues warrants for authorized City expenditures
which represent a claim for payment when presented to the City Treasurer. Payment for all City
warrants clearing is made by checks drawn on the City's various operating bank accounts.
The City Treasurer and City Comptroller share responsibility for investing in authorized
investments.  Interest earned and fair market value adjustments on pooled investments are
allocated to participating funds based on their average combined cash and investment balances.
Since investment income is derived from pooled investments, the fair value measurement and fair
value hierarchy disclosures of GASB 72 will not be separately presented in a note disclosure.
The City values its investments at fair value or amortized cost.  U.S. Government securities
purchased at a price other than par with a maturity of less than one year are recognized at
amortized cost.
Deferred Inflows
Deferred inflows represent deferred property tax revenue amounts to be recognized as revenue
in future years in the governmental fund financial statements.
Capital Assets
Capital assets are not capitalized in the governmental fund but, instead, are charged as current
expenditures when purchased. The Government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net
position and the statement of changes in net position) of the City includes the capital assets and
related depreciation, if any, of the Project in which ownership of the capital asset will remain with the
City (i.e. infrastructure, or municipal building). All other construction will be expensed in both the
government-wide financial statements and the governmental fund as the City nor Project will retain
the right of ownership.

Reimbursements
Reimbursements, if any, are made to the developer for project costs, as public improvements are
completed and pass City inspection. Refer to Note 4 for reimbursements paid to the developer.
Note 2 – Surplus Distribution
In December 2021, the City declared a surplus within the fund balance of the Project in the amount of
$7,398,400. In January 2022, the surplus funds were sent to the Cook County Treasurer’s Office to be
redistributed to the various taxing agencies.
Note 3 – Operating Transfers Out
During 2021, in accordance with State statutes, the Project transferred $5,770,000 to the contiguous
Archer/Western Redevelopment Project to fund the renovation of the McGuane Park Fieldhouse
located at 2901 South Poplar Avenue.
Note 4 – Tax Abatement Payments

ended December 31, 2021.
Note 5 – Commitments
The City has pledged certain amounts solely from available excess incremental taxes to provide financial
assistance to a developer under the terms of a redevelopment agreement for the purpose of paying costs
of certain eligible redevelopment project costs.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Honorable Lori E. Lightfoot, Mayor 
Members of the City Council 
City of Chicago, Illinois 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the 
financial statements of the 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois, which comprise the 
statement of net position and governmental fund balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, and the related statement 
of activities and governmental fund revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balance for the year then ended, 
and the related notes to the financial statements, and we have issued our report thereon dated June 27, 2022. 
 
In connection with our audit, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Project failed to comply 
with the regulatory provisions in Subsection (q) of Section 11-74.4-3 of the Illinois Tax Increment Allocation 
Redevelopment Act and Subsection (o) of Section 11-74.6-10 of the Illinois Industrial Jobs Recovery Law as they 
relate to the eligibility for costs incurred incidental to the implementation of the 35th/Halsted Redevelopment Project 
of the City of Chicago, Illinois. 
 
However, our audit was not directed primarily toward obtaining knowledge of such noncompliance.  Accordingly, 
had we performed additional procedures, other matters may have come to our attention regarding the Project’s 
noncompliance with the above referenced regulatory provisions, insofar as they relate to accounting matters. 
 
This report is intended for the information of the City of Chicago's management.  However, this report is a matter of 
public record, and its distribution is not limited.
