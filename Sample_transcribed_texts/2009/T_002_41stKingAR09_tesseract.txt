Basic Financial Statements

‘The basic franca! statements include two kinds of financial staemenis that present diferet views of the
Project ~ the Goverment Wide Financial Statemonts and the Gavormmontal Fund Financial Statements. These
financial statements also include the notes tothe financial statements that explain some ofthe information in the
financial statements and provide more deta

Government Wide Financia Statements

“The government wide financial statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the Project's
financial status and use accounting methods similar to those Used by private-sector companies. The statement
‘of net assets includes a of the project's assets and labltios. lof the current year's revenues and expenses
‘re accounted for in the statement of actives regardless of when cash is received oF paid. The two
‘government-wide statements report the Project's nat assols and how they have changed. Net assols ~ the
‘iference between the Project's assets and lables — is one way to measure the Projecs nancial heath, of
position

Governmental Fund Financial Statomonts

“The governmental fund financial statements provide moro detailed information about the Projects significant
{funds — not the Project as a whole. Governmental funds focus on: 1) how cash an other financial assets can
ready be converted to cash fows and 2} the year-end balances that are avaiabla for spending. Consequenty,
the governmental fund statements prove a detaled short-term view that helps determine whether there are
‘more financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the Project. Because this information
does not encompass the addtional longterm focus of the government-wide statements, we provide addtional
Information at tho battom af the statements fo explan the relationship (or diferences) batween tom,
