cash and Investments

cash belonging to the City is generally deposited with che
City Treasurer as required by the Municipal Code of Chicago. The
City Comptroller issues warrants for authorized City expenditures
which represent a claim for payment when presented to the City
Treasurer. Payment for all City warrants clearing is nade by
checks drawn on the City’s various operating bank accounts.

‘The City Treasurer and City Comptroller share responsibility
for investing in authorized investments, Interest earned on pooled
investments is allocated to participating funds based upon their
average combined cash and investment balance

On January 2, 1998, the City adopted GASB Statement No. 31,
"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain Investments and for
Sxternal Investment Pools.* Accordingly, the City values its
investments av fair value, or amortized cost.

Property Taxes

Property taxes are susceptible to accrual and recognized as a
receivable in the year levied. Revenue recognition is deferred
Unless the taxes are received within 60 daya subsequent to
year-end.
‘The City’s operations, like those of many other business en nay
pacted by the inability of certain computer prograns and electronic systens
embedded microprocessor chips to recognize calendar dates beyond the
year 1999. Unless such programs and microprocessors are modified or replaced
Brior to the year 2000, they may not function properly after 1999.

‘The City formed an executive committee in May 1998, to oversee possible
City-wide year 2000 impacts. The Department of Business and Information
Services has been charged with managing the City’s year 2000 project. The
year 2000 issue is covered within the scope of the city’s year 2000 project
The year 2000 project is divided into stages as follows:

Awareness Stage - Establishing a budget and project plan for dealing
with the year 2000 issue.

Assesmnent Stage - Identifying the mission critical systens, equipeent
and individual components for which year 2000 compliance is needed

Remediation Stage - Making changes to systems and equipment.

Validation/testing Stage - Validating and «1
made during the remediation stage.

ting the changes that were

‘The City comitted approximately $28.2 million and $32.0 million in 1998 and
1999, respectively, for the repair and replacement of year 2000 compromised
systens. As of December 31, 1998, the City entered into contracts for
approximately $17.7 million for the test plan development, audit stages and
Upgrade of certain software programs.

Mission Critical Applications

‘The City has identified one computer application, the Chicago Accounting and
Purchasing System, as critical to conducting the operations for year 2000
compliance, As of December 31, 1998, the City completed the awareness and
assessment stages, and the remediation stage was in process for the above
fission critical component. This mission critical component is still subject
to the validation/testing stage. The City-wide completion of all stages is
scheduled for September 1999.

Enbedded systems

‘The awareness stage, including an inventory of embedded systens has been
completed. Baseline assessment of mission critical functions involving
embedded systems was substantially completed by the end of the first quarter
of 1999. ‘The City has retained outside consultants to manage and implement
completion of this aspect of the year 2000 project by the end of September
1998
(Continued)

other Considerations

‘The City also initiated an assessment of mission critical vendors, which is
being performed by a consultant with oversight from the executive conmittes
£0 pian for continuity in the City’s supply chain. Contingency planning for
mission critical systems and other elements of the year 2000 project is
Scheduled to be completed by the end of Septenber 1333,

‘The above description of the stages of work to address the year 2000 issues
is not a guarantee those systems will be year 2000 compliant. Although the
City is currently on schedule to meet ita objectives for year’ 2000
compliance, there is no assurance that compliance will be achieved in a
tinely manner. Further, if the City successfully addresses its year 2000
issues, there is no assurance that any other entity or governnental agency
(including governmental organizations or entities that provide essential
infrastructure) with which the City electronically interacts will be year
2000 compliant. "At this tine, the City can not determine the potential
