to provide ease of reading, only major boundary streets are identified. For exact boundaries, the
interested reader should consult the legal description of the Project Area boundaries found in the
Redevelopment Plan (Attachment)..

related to a specific TIF project, and not elsewhere reported. Items include, but are not limited to.
payments for work done to acquire, dispose of, or lease property within a Project Area, or payments

(h) SUMMARY OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
During 1998, there was no information available regarding public or private investment activity
in the Project Area..
pm
 
12
The year 2ooo information on pages 7 and s is nct a required part of the
financial statements, but is supplementary information required by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board, and we did not audit and do not
express an opinion on such information. Further, we were unable to apply to
the information certain procedures prescribed by professional standards.
because of the unprecedented nature of the year 2ooo issue and its effects,
and the fact that authoritative measurement criteria regarding the status of
remediation efforts have not been established.  In addition, we do not
H#r
provide assurance that the City of Chicago is or will become year 2o00.
compliant, that the City of Chicago's year 2ooo remediation efforts will be
successful in whole or in part, or that parties with which the City of
Chicago does business are or will become year 2ooo compliant.
. . 
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule of cash activities on.
page 9 and the schedule of expenditures by statutory code on page 10, which
are also the responsibility of the City of Chicago's management, are
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of
the financial statements of 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project of the City
of Chicago, Illinois. Such additional information has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, in
our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects when considered in.
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

YEAR 2OO READINESS DISCLOSURE (UNAUDITED
The City's operations, like those of many other business entities, may be
impacted by the inability of certain computer programs and electronic systems
with embedded microprocessor chips to recognize calendar dates beyond the
year 1999. Unless such programs and microprocessors are modified or replaced
prior to the year 20o0, they may not function properly after 1999..
The City formed an executive committee in May 1998, to oversee possible
City-wide year 200o impacts.
The Department of Business and Information.
Services has been charged with managing the City's year 2ooo project. The
year 2ooo issue is covered within the scope of the City's year 2ooo project.
The year 20oo project is divided into stages as follows:
Awareness stage - Establishing a budget and project plan for dealing
with the year 2000 issue..
Assessment Stage - Identifying the mission critical systems, equipment
and individual components for which year 2ooo compliance is needed..
Remediation stage - Making changes to systems and equipment.
Validation/testing Stage - Validating and testing the changes that were.
made during the remediation stage..
The City committed approximately $28.2 million and $32.0 million in 1998 and
1999, respectively, for the repair and replacement of year 2o00 compromised
sy$tems.
 As of December 3l, 1998, the City entered into contracts for
approximately $17.7 million for the test plan development, audit stages and
upgrade of certain software programs..
Mission Critical Applications
:
The City has identified one computer application, the Chicago Accounting and
Purchasing System, as critical to conducting the operations for year 2o00
compliance. As of December 3l, 199s, the City completed the awareness and
assessment stages, and the remediation stage was in process for the above
mission critical component. This mission critical component is still subject
to the validation/testing stage. The City-wide completion of all stages is
scheduled for September 1999..
Embedded Systems.
. --
The awareness stage, including an inventory of embedded systems has been.
completed.
Baseline assessment of mission critical functions involving
embedded systems was substantially completed by the end of the first quarter
of 1999. The City has retained outside consultants to manage and implement.
completion of this aspect of the year 2ooo project by the end of September
1999.
P.
YEAR 2OOO READINESS DISCLOSURE (UNAUDITED
(Continued)
Other Considerations
The City also initiated an assessment of mission critical vendors, which is
being performed by a consultant with oversight from the executive committee
to plan for continuity in the City's supply chain. Contingency planning for
mission critical systems and other elements of the year 2ooo project is
scheduled to be completed by the end of September 1999.
The above description of the stages of work to address the year 2ooo issues
is not a guarantee those systems will be year 2ooo compliant. Although the
City is currently on schedule to meet its objectives for year 2000
compliance, there is no assurance that compliance will be achieved in a
timely manner. Further, if the City successfully addresses its year 2000
issues, there is no assurance that any other entity or governmental agency
(including governmental organizations or entities that provide essential
infrastructure) with which the City electronically interacts will be year
200o compliant.  At this time, the City can not determine the potential
impact of such noncompliance on the business and financial condition or the
results of its operations.

NTRODUCTION
 
This document presents the recommended Tax Increment Redevelopment Plan and Project for the
43rd and Damen industrial area located in the Stockyards Industrial Cornidor on Chicago's south
side. The plan and project respond to problem conditions including the presence of numerous
blighting factors, and a lack of private investment within the srudy area, and reflect the commitment
by the City of Chicago to improve and revitalize the Redevelopment Project Area. Private
development and investment in the area cannot be reasonably expected to occur without the
Ieadership and assistance of the City including the adoption of chis Redevelopment Plan and Project,
and the use of tax increment financing..
Tax Increment Financingd
In adopting the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, the lilinois State Legislature found
that
"... there exist in many municipalities within this State blighted, conservation and industrial park
conservation areas, that the conservation areas are rapidly deteriorating and declining and may
soon become blighted areas if their decline is not checked...It is hereby found and declared that
in order to promote and protect the health, safery, morals, and welfare of the public, that blighted
conditions need to be eradicated and conservation measures instituted, and that redevelopment
"1-
of such areas be undertaken...The eradication of blighted areas and treatment and improvement
--
of conservation areas and industial park conservation areas is hereby declared to be essential to
the public interest.'
In order to use the tax increment tinancing technique, a municipality must first establish that the
proposed redevelopment project azea meets the statutory criteria for designation as a "blighted area",
a "conservation area" or an "industrial conservation area". A redevelopment plan must then be
prepared which describes the development or redevelopment progran intended to be undertaken to
reduce or eliminate those conditions which qualified the redevelopment project area as a "blighted
area", "conservation area", or combination thereof, or "industrial conservation area", and thereby
enhance the tax bases of the taxing districts which extend into the redevelopment project area.
Redevelopment projects are defined as any public or private development projects underaken in
furtherance of the objectives of the redevelopment plan.
The legislation requires that each redevelopment plan set forth in writing the program which will be
undertaken to accomplish the municipality's redevelopment objectives. The Act also states that
"No redevelopment plan shall be adopted unless... (l) The municipality finds that the
redevelopment project area on the whole has not been subject to growth and development
through investment by private enterprise and would not be reasonably be anticipated to be
developed without the adoption of the redevelonment plan, (2) The municipality finds that the
redevelopment plan and project conform to che comprehensive plan for the development of the
municipality as a whole, or for municipalities with a population of 100,o00 ar more, regardless of
when the redevelopment plan and project was adopted, the redevelopment plan and project
either: (i] conforms to the strategic economic development or redevelopment plan issued by the
designated planning authority of the municipality, or (ii) includes land uses that have been
---
approved by the planning commission of the municipality, (3) The redevelopment plan
establishes the estimated dates of completion of the redevelopment proiect and retirement of
obligations issued to finance redevelopment project costs. Those dates shall not be rnore than 23.
years from the adoption of the ordinance approving the redevelopment project area, if the
ordinance was adopted on or after January 15, 198I, and not more than 35 years if the ordinance
was adopted before January I5, 198l or if the municipality is subject to the Local Govemment
Financial Planning and Supervision Act.., [4) The municipality finds, in the case of an indusuial
i
park conservation area, also that the municipality is a labor surplus municipality and that the
implementation of the redevelopment plan will reduce unemployment, create new jobs and by
the provision of new facilities enhance the tax base of the taxing disuicts that extend into the.
redevelopment project area. (5) If any incremental revenues are being utilized under Section
8{a{1) or 8{a)(2) of this Act in redevelopment project areas approved by ordinance after January 1,
1986, the municipality finds (a) that the redevelopment project area would not reasonably be
developed without the use of such incremental revenues, and (b) that such incremental revenues
will be exclusively utilized for the development of the redevelopment project area.".
Pursuant to the provisions contained in the Act, the City of Chicago has authorized an evaluation of
whether a portion of the 43rd and Damen industrial area qualifies for designation as a "blighted area'
and, if the area so qualifies, the preparation of a redevelopment plan for the redevelopment project
area in accordance with the requirements of the Act..
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project Area.
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Proiect Area is located within the Stockyards Industrial
Corridar on Chicago's south side. The Redevelopment Project Area is generally bounded by the east
line of the east 1/2 of the Nw 1/4 of Section 6-38-14, then east along the south right-of-way line of
then generally southwest along the Chicago River and Industrial Railroad Company right-of-way to
the east right-of-way line of Damen Avenue, then west to the west right-of-way line of Damen
Avenue, then north approximately ll0 feet, then southwest along the southeastem property line of
tax parcel 20-0s-30i-0I4, then generally north along the western property line of said parcel
continuing north along the western property line of tax parcel 20-06-30l-Ol0 to a point
approximately 250 feet south of the south right-of-way line of 43rd Street then west approximately
100 feet, then north approximately 250 feet to the south right-of-way line of 43rd Street, then west
approximately 1,O60 feet, then north to the north right-of-way line of 43rd Street, then east to the
west line of the east 1/2 of the Nw 1/4 of Section 6-38-14, then north a distance of approximately
625 feet, then cast a distance of approximately 660 feet, then north a distance of approximately 28
feet, then east a distance of approximately 655 feet to the east line of the east 1/2 of the NW 1/4 of
Section 6-38-14 then south to the point of beginning. The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project
Area is approximately 35.96 acres in size and is bordered on the east by the Stockyards Tax
Increment Financing District which was established in 1989..
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project Area has not been subject to growth and development
by private enterprise. An analysis of conditions within the redevelopment project area indicates that
it is appropriate for designation as a redevelopment project in accordance with the State of liinois
tax increment tinancing legislation..
The analysis disclosed that the area was originally developed without the benefit or guidance of
Overall community planning, and that the area does not meet basic standards and guidelines for
!
contemporary development. As a result of these and other factors, the area is characterized by
conditions that warrant the designation of the entire area as a "blighted area" under the definitions
set forth in the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act of the State of Illinois (hereinafter
reterred to as the "Act"].
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Plan and Proiect have been formulated in accordance with the
provisions of the Act. This document is a guide to all proposed public and private actions in the
Redevelopment Project Area.

REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project Area is generally bounded by the east line of the east
1/2 of the NW 1/4 of Section 6-38-14, then east along the south right-of-way line of 43rd Street to a.
point approximately l30 feet west of the west right-of-way line of Wolcott Avenue, then generally
southwest along the Chicago River and Industrial Railroad Company right-of-way to the east right-.
of-way Line of Damen Avenue, then west to the west right-of-way line of Damen Avenue, then
snorth approximately 1I0 feet, then southwest along the southeastern property line of tax parcel 20-
06-30i-014, then generally north along the westem properry line of said parcel, continuing north
along the western property line of tax parcel 20-06-301-010 to a.point approximately 250 feet south
of the south right-of-way line of 43rd Street then west approximately l00 feet, then north
approximately 250 feet to the south right-of-way line of 43rd Street, then west approximately 1,060
feet, then north to the north right-of-way line of 43rd Street, then east to the west line of the east 1/2
of the NW 1/4 of Section 6-38-14, then north a distance of approximately 625 feet, then east a
distance of approximately 660 feet, then north a distance of approximately 28 feet, then east a
distance of approximately 655 feet to the east line of the east I/2 of the Nw 1/4 of Section 6-38-14
then south to the point of beginning. The boundaries of the Redevelopment Project Area are shown
in Figure 1. The Redevelopment Project Area is approximately 35.96 acres in size.
A legal description of the Redevelopment Project Area is included as Appendix A of this document.
The proposed redevelopment project area includes only contiguous parcels, qualifies for designation
as a "blighted area' and is not Iess that 1-1/2 acres in aggregate as required by the Act. The proposed
Redevelopment Project Area includes only that area which is anticipated to be substantially
benefited by the proposed redevelopment project improvements..
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project Area is Iocated in the Stockyards Industrial Cormidor.
The Redevelopment Project Area presently consists of 24 parcels of vacant and improved industrial
property under multiple ownerships. Five tax parcels in the study area are railroad property. A review.
of City zoning and base maps indicates that this area once contained many rail spurs which no
longer exist.
The predominant land use in the Redevelopment Project Area is warehouse and distribution. Other
industrial uses surround the redevelopment project area. The present land use distribution is shown
in Figure 2.
7
---
The Redevelopment Project Area is presently zoned as a M2-3 General Manufacturing District east.
of Damen and as a M3-5 Heavy Manufacturing District west of Damen{Figure 3).
The Dry Storage Corporation is the largest property owner in the Redevelopment Project Area. Dry
Storage holdings include approximately 620,o00 square feet of warehouse space divided among six
buildings on slightly less than I8 acres of land..
Truck access to the Redevelopment Project Area is provided viz 43rd Street. Damen Avenue is
elevated through the Redevelopment Project area and does not provide direct truck access. Pedestrian
access is provided by two stairways from Damen Avenue to 43rd Street below. 43rd Street is paved.
however, other public and private rights-of-way serving the study area exist as unimproved dirt and
gravel roadways.
3
The area was developed in two major waves. The earliest buildings were built in the early 19o0's and
located in the southeast quadrant of the study area and were designed to take advancage of the
.-.
numerous rail spurs that served the aea. The remaining buildings in the study area were built
between 1962 and 1974. It was during this period that the area assumed its current identity as a
strong warehouse and distribution district.

ELIGIBILITY OF THE PROJECT AREA FOR DESIGNATION AS A BLIGHTED
AREA
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project Area on the whole has not been subject to growth and
developmenc through investment by private enterprise. Based on the conditions present, the area is.
not likely to be developed without the adoption of the redevelopaent plan..
In February, 1994 a study was undertaken to establish whether the proposed redevelopment project.
area is eligible for designation as a blighted area in accordance with the reguirements of the "Real.
Property Tax Increment Allocation Development Act." This. analysis concluded that the area.
qualifies as a blighted area.
Of the 14 factors cited in the Act, 8 factors are present within the 43rd and Damen Redevelopment.
Project Area. Five are required in order for the area to be designated as blighted. The following.
blighting factors were found to be present within the Redevelopment Proiect Are:
Age
Deleterious land use or layout
Depreciation of physical maintenance
Deterioration
Excessive land coverage
Inadequate Utilities.
Lack of community planning
Obsolescence
Several unused railroad parcels were also found to be present in the study area..
The specific basis upon which eligibiliry for designation as a blighted area was established, is.
presented in the 43rd and Damen Tax Increment Redevelopment Project Eligibility Repart..

COMMUNITY PLANNING OBJECTIVES/REDEVELOPMENT PLAN GOALS
AND OBJECTIVES
The proposed 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Plan and Project are consistent with the City of
Chicago's industrial development policies articulated in the City's CORRiDORS OF INDUSTRLAL
QppoRTuNrty: A Plan for Industry in Chicago's Wiest Side and companion documents prepared for
Chicago's North and South Sides. As stated in these industrial policy documents:.
 The creation and preservation of jobs for Chicago residents is a major economic development
goal of the city...In support of its job creation goal, the City's industrial Iand use policy seeks to
provide opportunities for synergy between related industrial activities, to minimize the conflicts
between industial and other Land uses, and to maximize the benefits of public investment in
capital programming and related industrial investment."
The adopted industrial land use policy is supported by a nine point implementation strategy:
I. Adopt an industial land use plan which designates viable and well defined industrial
corridors.
Maintain the industrial integrity of the corridor by requiring that proposals for non-industrial
development and proposals for rezoning to non-industrial districs be approved as planned
developments.
3.  Continue the selective use of the Planned Manufacturing District mechanism as a tool for
assuring stability of land use'in the City's industrial areas.
+.
Amend the provisions of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance applicable to the manufacturing
zoning districts for a classification of uses and associated development standards which are
congruent with the needs of modern industrial development.
5. Rezone the non-industrial zoned properties within the corridor and, as nectssary, existing
industrially zoned properties consistent with the appropriate modified M-zoning category.
6.
Give priority consideration to the operational needs of existing industrial uses when
reviewing the rezoning of industrial property outside of industrial corridors.
7.
Establish an interdepartmental program to identify and regularly update the infrastructure
needs of industy throughout the City.
8.
Feature the industrial park opportunities identified in the land use plan in citywide programs.
to attract, eapand and retain industry. Identify land in industrial corridors for industrial park.
development and create programs to assist the private sector in the development of these
sites.
9. Identify Rail Access Development Areas and foster a closer relationship between the
railroads and the City to enhance the development and marketing of rail properties and.
services.
9
The 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Plan and Project will enhance the City's ability to achieve its
goals. Ihe Proposed Redevelopment' Plan and Project is consistent with adopted industrial.
development policies because it maintains the industrial integriry of the corridor and will facilitate.
industrial expansion elsewhere in the City.
Redevelopmeot Plan Goals and Objectives
The overall goal of the 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Plan is to stimulate private industrial
investment in the area in order to enhance property values and attract and retain industrial users.
who will provide jobs and enhance Chicago's industrial property tax base. The City's goals and
objectives of encouraging development and private investment will be realized by:
 Achieving significant new industrial growth in a declining area.
Undertaking necessary site development to meet the needs of identified new industial users.
 Implementing a plan that addresses the redevelopment costs of land acquisition, site
improvements, and other activities that may be necessary to encourage industrial growth of the
Redevelopment Project Area.
Improving public facilities that may include, but are not limited to, roadway improvements.
Entering into redevelopment agreements and by exercising other powers set forth in the Act as
the City of Chicago deems necessary in order to implement the 43rd and Damen Redevelopment.
Plan and Project.

Sources of Funds
 m
Funds necessary to pay for redevelopment proiect costs and municipal obligations which have been
issued to pay for such costs are to be derived principally from tax incremenc revenues and proceeds
from municipai obligations which have as their revenue source tax increment revenue..
The tax increment revenue which will be used to fund tax increment obligations and redevelopment
project costs shall be the incremental real property taxes. Increnental real property tax revenue is
attributable to the increase in the current equalized assessed value of each taxable lot, block, tract or.
parcel of real property in the Redevelopment Project Area over and above the initial equalized.
assessed value of each such property in the Redevelopment Project Area. Other sources of funds
which may be used to pay for redevelopment costs and obligations issued, the proceeds of which are
used to pay for such costs, are land disposition proceeds, state and federal grants, investment income,.
and such other sources of funds and revenues as the municipaliry may from time to time deem
appropriate.
The City may issue general obligation bonds secured by the full faith and credit of the City for the
purpose of financing redevelopment project costs. Such bonds may be payable from ad valorem taxes
levied against all taxable property in the City of Chicago.
Development of the 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project Area would not be reasonably expected
to occur without the use of the incremental revenues provided by the Act Redevelopment project
costs include those eligible project costs set forth in the Act and not the full range of development
costs associated with the proposed Redevelopment Project. The majority of development costs will
be privately financed. Tax increment financing or other public sources will be used only to the.
extent needed to secure commitments for private redevelopment activity..
Nature and.Temm of Obligations to be Issued
The City of Chicago may issue obligations secured by the tax incremcnt special tax allocation fund
established for the project area pursuant to the Act or such other funds or security as are available to

Anticipated Equalized Assessed Valnation
Once the project has been completed and the property is fully assessed, the equalized assessed
valuation of real property within the Redevelopment Project Area is estimated at $7,978,654. This
estimate has been calculated assuming that the Redevelopment Project Area will be developed in
accordance with the general land use plan described in Chapter 7 of this document.
a
The estimated equalized assessed valuation assumes that the assessed value of property within the
study area will increase substantially as a result of planned acquisition and improvements involving
several large warehouse buildings within the Redevelopment Project Area.
1
1
Calculation of the projected equalized assessed valuation is based on several other key assumptions,
including: 1) redevelopment of the 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Area will occur in a timely
manner; and 2) the application of a State Multiplier of 1.99s3 to the projected assessed value of
property within the study area. The projected State Multiplier was calculated by averaging the State
Multipliers for Cook County for the most recent five year period (1988 through1992).
Financial Impact on Taxing Districts
1
Because the proposed Redevelopment Plan and Project involves acquisition and improvement of
existing buildings, and not new construction, the financial impact of the redevelopment project is
expected to be negligible. No increased demands for services from any taxing district affected by the
Redevelopment Pian and Project are anticipated.
19
i
AIthough ao short-term financial or service demand impacts are expected to resuit from adoption of
this Redevelopment Plan and Project, it is hoped that additional private investment wil be attracted
to the area over the life of the Redevelopment Project. Since the specific nature of such investments
:
cannot be determined at this time, the financial impacts on the various taxing jurisdictions or
increased service demands resulting from such new development cannot be quantified. However,
because of cunrent zoning, the existing land use patten, and the City's adopted industial land use
policy, any new development is likely to be industrial in nature. As a result, increased service
demands are likely to be limited to utilities either provided by the City of Chicago or the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. The City will monitor and assess the
financial impact or increased service demands on affected taxing jurisdicrions and develop specific
.
plans to address any such impacts that may occur over the life of the Redevelopment Project.
Real estate tax revenues resulting from increases in the egualized assessed value over and above the
certified initial equalized assessed value established with the adoption of this Redevelopment Plan
and Project will be used to pay eligible redevelopment costs in the area. At the end of such period.
the real estate tax revenues attributable to the increase in the equalized assessed value over the
certified initial equalized assessed value will be distributed to all taxing districts Ievying property
taxes against property located in the Redeveloprnent Proiect Area Successful implementation of this
Redevelopment Plan and Project is expected to result in new development and private investment on
a scale sufficient to overcome blighted conditions and substantially improve the long-term economic
yalue of the are.
Ea.
Completion of the Redevelopment Project and Retirement of Obligations to Finance Redevelopment
Project Costs
This Redevelopment Project will be completed on or before a date twenty-three (23} years from the
adoption of the ordinance designating the Redevelopment Project Area. The City of Chicago expects
that the Redevelopment Project wilil be completed sooner than the maximum time limit set by the
Act.

CITY OF CHICAGO COMMITMENT TO FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICESS
AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
 -
As part of any Redevelopment Agreement entered into by the City and the private developer, both
will agree tc establish and implement an affirmative action program that serves appropriate sectors
of the City of Chicago.
With respect to the public/private development's internal operations, both entities will pursue
employment practices which provide equal opportunity to ail people regardless of sex, color, race or
creed. Neither parry will countenance discrimination against any employee or applicant because of
sex, marital status, national origin, age, or the presence of physical handicaps. These
nondiscriminatory practices will apply to all areas of employment, including hiring, upgrading and
promotions, termination's, compensation, benefit programs and educational opportunities.
Anyone involved with employment or contracting activities for this Redevelopment Project will be
responsible for conformance with this policy and the compliance requirements of applicable state.
and federal regulations.
The City and the private developers involved in the implementation of this Redevelopment Project
will adopt a policy of equal employment opportunity and will include or require the inclusion of this
statement in all contracts and subcontracts at any level for the Project being undertaken in the
1
Redevelopment Project Area. Any public/private partnership established for the development project
in the Redevelopment Project Area will seek to ensure and maintain a working environmcnt free of
harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites, and in all facilities at which employees are
assigned to work. It shall be specificzlly ensured that all on-site supervisory personnel are aware of
and carry out the obligation to maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to
minority and/or female individuals. The partmership will utilize affirmative action to ensure that
business opportunities are provided and that job applicants are cmployed and treated in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
Underlying this policy is the recognition that successful affirmative action programs are important.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORI
The Honorable Richard M. Daley, Mayor
Members of the City Council.
City of Chicago, Illinois
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of the 43rd and Damen.
Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December 31,
1997, and the related statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in
fund balance for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the City of Chicago's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards reguire that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free.
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial state-
ments. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.
 We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the 43rd and Damen
Redevelopment Project of the City of Chicago, Illinois, as of December 3l,
1997, and the results of its operations and changes in fund balance for the
year  then.
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule of cash activities on
page 6 and the schedule of expenditures by statutory code on page 7, which.
are also the responsibility of the City of Chicago's management, are
.j
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part
of the financial statements of 43rd and Damen Redevelopment Project of the
City of Chicago, Illinois. Such additional information has been subjected
to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements
and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects when
considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
